No melatonin. No light therapy. Again targeted the biological night suggested by wearables data (midnight-1am to 8-9am), and it worked wonderfully! So the wearables seem to correctly estimate the circadian rhythm! Also the switch from nap to a full night was instantaneous, which contradicts my previous assumption that it was necessarily to sleep in phase a few days before the body had enough time to habituate to a longer sleep. Of course the 1st night was cut in half as there was a hole at 4am the previous night sleep, so it was still a bit biphasic, so either there some habitation going on or low sleep pressure does that or the short day (12h) leads to a reduced exposure to bright light and hence caused biphasic sleep (as demonstrated by the study comparing 10h vs 16h exposure, with 10h causing biphasic sleep), but in the end the body habituated over a single night, despite sleeping with little slenp pressure and at a totally different time than usual! So no need for progressive sleep timing change, it's more efficient to switch to biological night directly. Also this suggests that the vlidacmel therapy phase advanced me much more than expected, despite the suboptimal conditions such as using light therapy and melatonin late (never before 2pm the last 10 days or more, since i thought my circadian phase was this late, hence about 5h later than the optimal time! ). So they phase advanced me a lot even though they were used way past their respective tipping point! Ate 1.5 pain au chocolat + sugar cookies, so carbs aren't an issue. I just timed meals to ensure digestion would not affect sleep and avoid guts circadian misalignment, that's the only thing i manipulated these last 2 days, but not diet content nor melatonin nor light therapy nor work.

No melatonin. No light therapy. Wearables data suggested circadian misalignment previous data, because of too much phase advance possibly due to too much use of vlidacmel (since we have no circadian rhythm monitoring tool it's possible to overshoot...). Data suggested circadian night is around 8pm to 4am with CBTmin at 10pm, but could not sleep that early since woke up in the afternoon, so slept as early as possible but later than 8pm. Did not expect to sleep so long for the first test night. Next night will attempt to sleep even earlier. EDIT: after reprocessing and correcting data, CBTmin is rather around 7am and hence biological night between midnight and 8am. CBTmin today of this specific night is rather 8am, but since no therapy has been done it may be because of freerunning (it restarts so quickly???). Interestingly i went outside to paint something for 2h between 4pm and 6pm, and my temperature was never as low as CBTmin, so it's not correlated with ambient temperature. "

Melatonin at 01h00. Light therapy for 4h. No idea why sleep is so short, it's basically just a nap. No environmental factor. Felt very tired before sleep. No change in my routine except for trying to eat honey uast 3 days (except didn't on day before the day of current record). Plus vivid dreams (but positive) last few days. Not feeling tired at all at wake up and relatively good energy during the day although feeling slightly physically and mentally tired, not feeling like I'm sleep deprived much but i know I am and likely have cognitive deficits, it's very weird. Also wearing chest strap all time since Tuesday, but i already did a similar experiment the week before without sleep issue. No stressor and worked little (on wearables), no appointments, the whole week can be described as very peaceful! No particular noise or whatever. No anxiety, feeling quite good mood wise or even excited by progress and results of months of preparation on the wearables project. Reserving my time and stopping activities from 1am every night to wind down and feel sleepiness. All conditions both environmental and internal and endogenous were perfect for a full week of good sleep, yet it was the opposite. Only weird thing yesterday evening is diarrhea but not during sleep, before! Also this indigestion may be due to short sleep and circadian misalignment, or to honey fructose. Woken up by thirst, but drank bedside bottle and immediately went back to sleep but could not sleep! It may be a sudden jump in circadian rhythm timing but this is unlikely because even when i sleep in complete circadian misalignment, my sleep sessions (long naps) last between 4h30 and 5h30, more often in the 5h to 5h30 range, but here i sleep less than 4h!

Did not use a blanket and left armpit always closed so any change of temperature in ibutton sensor is not confounded by body position or other. All along, bird O sang and screamed loudly starting at 16h20 up to 17h20, helped me stay somewhat conscious but still fell asleep already at 16h05 and all along because time seemed subjectively much shorter than 1h, even with the bird screaming and no auditory protection. Bird was screaming loudly right at about 70cm of my ears (todo: add decibels later). SO was surprised i could stay mostly asleep. Hence this shows this was an irresistible nap. Pretty sure the subjective feelings of temperature changes should be observable on ibutton temperature profile under the armpit, another demonstration the nap was due to body regulation and hence irresistible, with raising temperature before and decreasing at the end (confirmed). Why did this irresistible nap happen? Likely due to chronic sleep deprivation due to continuous circadian misalignment the last few days (as i had no obligation to wake up, it's just my body which can't sleep any longer, but it catches up later a bit by generating naps).

There was no disturbances at all, no sleep deprivation, and everything was done on time, it was a perfect day. I woke up naturally after likely very little deep sleep because: 1- my nightmare was very long, i thought i slept longer, 2- i woke up overburning, sweating, when in fact i was told by relative that the temperature was significantly cooler than when i went to sleep. So it's the perfect evidence of an endogenous chaotic shift in my sleep. I woke up very alert (high vigilance), but cognitively tired. No apparent for wake up, used new outer ear plugs in silicon, no noise, not hungry nor thirsty, no sanitary needs, nothing apart from elevated body temperature unrelated to ambient temperature.

Slept late simply because did not feel fatigued. Took time to fall asleep even this late, I forced myself. I did eat a bit of meat when coming back home after errands, around 19h, so no evening fasting. Maybe that's why? "

Melatonin at 20h10. Worked late because was not tired. Woke up by myself, surprisingly not so tired and without headache nor palpitations. Highly important night observation : was not tired even at 4h when I tried to sleep. But woke up without major issues earlier. Which means that the wake up time is managed by an independent process, different from the fatigue process which governs bedtime, contrary to what we usually believe. So need to treat them separately : wakeup time by luminette at wake-up (melatonin inhibition) , sleep time by timed eating and/or ketogenic and/or melatonin? (melatonin synthesis kick-start and adenosine buildup and avoid dopamine production because of sleep deprivation). But shows that process S, adenosine buidup and reduction, does not impact the circadian rhythm! Also probably timed eating plays a big role because yesterday, melatonin was taken at usual hours, only thing that changed was the later eating time (and a nap, but it was short and in the past naps did not change much to my fatigue at sleep). So either timed eating impacted, either the nap interacted with melatonin because timing was too close, but this hypothesis is unlikely since melatonin stopped early in the morning as evidenced by early wakeup time! Hypothesis is that melatonin and luminette work together on circadian rhythm, timed eating and keto on process S (avoid postprandial fatigue). And despite being sad at sleep time because of grieving. Also started new pack of melatonin (same brand and dosage and instant release formulation). "
