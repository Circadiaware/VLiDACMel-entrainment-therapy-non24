<li>BEST CRITICAL: wrist skin temperature using iButton on the AX6 watch using velcro, this may allow to detect the circadian rhythm! See <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23577201/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23577201/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23577201/</a> and especially <b>WTiO (Wrist skin temperature increase onset) which anticipates melatonin production</b>: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164100/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164100/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164100/</a>
<ul>
<li><b>To summarize: wrist skin temperature (WTiO) can detect start of biological night (associated with the DLMO), and minimal core body temperature (CBTmin) the end (light therapy)! It can also detect the siesta time, which is independent from feeding time!</b></li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: wrist skin temperature (distal temperature) placement using Velcro to attach the iButton to a cotton sports wristband! + one sample every 10min is very fine! So every 5min is even better!</b> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/</a></li>

</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: arduino DIY light sensor rethink with a light intensity sensor with blue-green light filter, to directly get the intensity of exposure to blue-light! <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device" title="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device" class="https">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334043969_Determining_Light_Intensity_Timing_and_Type_of_Visible_and_Circadian_Light_From_an_Ambulatory_Circadian_Monitoring_Device</a></li>
<li>BEST IDEA WEARABLE ME ALL-IN-ONE: make my own ECG optical + thermistor + 3-axis accelerometer on armband with microsd card and bluetooth streaming using an arduino-like board with breakouts, this should be sufficient to capture skin temperature + RR intervals (heart rate and heart rate variability) + activity (sleep-wake phases - actigraphy). First confirm that these measures work to monitor the circadian rhythm (and determine with what algorithms), then I can try to make this all-in-one wearable with both data storage for offline analysis and online streaming via bluetooth for users to monitor in real-time their circadian rhythm (and stream the history too this is necessary).
<ul>
<li>IT EXISTS! Except for ECG. Recommend for researchers this all-in-one system: <b>ACM KRONOWISE® 2.0 watch, all-in-one system for circadian rhythm study and assessment</b>, combined with the Circadianware platform for light sensing, wrist skin temperature and 3-axis actigraphy! Used in lots of research studies already with Circadianware software: <a href="http://www.kronohealth.com/productos-y-servicios/" title="http://www.kronohealth.com/productos-y-servicios/" class="http">http://www.kronohealth.com/productos-y-servicios/</a></li>

<h2>Wearables donning procedure</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>AX6: wristwatch arrow facing outwards towards the ground on the left wrist (and the Axivity logo on the wrist facing towards the body).</li>
<li>Method wearables avoid superficial skin damage:
<ul>
<li>Move wearable belt up or down every day and before sleeping, data quality a bit worse but it's still usable and it's necessary to avoid skin damage when worn 24/7.</li>
<li>Use silicone micropore because can be moved and retaped, for ibuttons. </li>
<li>Ask on reddit how to avoid skin damage when wearing a chest belt 24/7? Even medical tape without adhesives are causing same issues. Need to disinfect? With what to preserve the skin? </li>
<li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7147274/</a>
<ul>
<li>Not too much pressure, important to allow for blood circulation in the superficial skin layers.</li>
<li>"One study found that 52% of medical staff with hand eczema wash their hands more than 10 times per day.10 Long-term disinfectant use also influences the microbiota and changes the immune microenvironment on the skin surface, resulting in conditions such as eczema, fungal infection, bacterial infection, and allergic dermatitis."</li>
<li>"Adequate cleaning and moisturizing are the basis of skin barrier maintenance. An appropriate cleaning frequency removes dirt, bacteria, and some sweat and oil from the skin surface, which reduces the irritation caused by their long-term presence and reduces the risk of infection. Adequate moisturizing helps maintain the moisture content of the corneum, maintains the “brick-wall” structure of the epidermis, and facilitates cell self-repair.18 Basic moisturizing usually consists of two categories: the application of a water-soluble moisturizer (including glycerin and sodium hyaluronate) that supplements natural moisturizing factors to lock in moisture,19 and the application of squalane, mineral oils, and various natural oils to replenish sebum, which forms an oil film on the skin surface to prevent water loss. People with rich sebum in a closed equipment environment should use water-soluble moisturizers to prevent excessive oil from blocking the pores and causing acne."</li>
<li>"Acne treatment: Apart from wearing appropriate PPE and avoiding prolonged use, general treatments include: proper skin cleansing, a reasonable selection of skincare products (mainly water-soluble moisturizers and no hormones), a low-sugar diet, and avoidance of squeezing pimples with the hands."</li>
<li>WARNING source may not be very reliable: "Traditional Chinese medicine or photodynamic therapy can also be used."</li>
</ul>

<li>Google wearing medical superficial skin damage</li>
<li>Essayer de mettre une compresse en dessous pour absorber humidité ! </li>
<li>Wearables change chestbelt position twice a day, at wake up and then before sleep.</li>
<li>Ibuttons with medical tape move every 1 or 2 days to the other armpit. With the silicone micropore tape, it's possible to reuse the same tape, it will still stick because no adhesive is used, it's based on pressure.</li>
<li>If itchy, don't hesitate to scratch gently and move the chest belt a bit. If the itchiness feeling is repeating, then it's a clear sign it's time to move the chest belt to another skin location.</li>
<li>For the chest belt any location on the chest as high as below the nipples or as low as the belly should work fine to acquire a sufficiently good ecg signal, as can be checked by looking at the graph and observing a QRS shaped complex. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Acquisition procedure</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Actigraphy: Axivity AX6:
<ul>
<li>Remove from watch and connect to a computer through USB</li>
<li>use OmGUI</li>
<li>Download, wait for 100% transfer (and battery recharge, make sure the computer is plugged to outlet for faster recharge)</li>
<li>Rename the downloaded file to add current daytime (else it's not in the filename and it can get overwritten)</li>
<li>Back up the cwa files directly, can always export and normalize later, directly from OmGUI or other softwares/libraries.</li>
<li>Wipe device</li>
<li>Click Record and Reconfigure with 100Hz sampling frequency, 16bit and 2000dps gyro/rotation.</li>
<li>Disconnect and put back inside silicon watch, matching the arrow on the AX6 with the watch's arrow marker.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skin temperature: Thermocron iButton DS1922L or DS1925L:
<ul>
<li>use softwares in <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/one-wire/software-tools.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/one-wire/software-tools.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/one-wire/software-tools.html</a> as described in <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1925EVKIT.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1925EVKIT.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1925EVKIT.html</a> (note all softwares are opensource)</li>
<li>DS9490R and DS1402D-DR8+ to connect by USB to computer</li>
<li>install 1-Wire drivers, then launch <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/one-wire/software-tools/viewer.html" title="OneWireViewer" class="https">OneWireViewer</a> — can use opensource java: <a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/" title="https://adoptopenjdk.net/" class="https">https://adoptopenjdk.net/</a></li>
<li>Main procedure to do each time:
<ul>
<li>Plug the iButton into one of the bluedot receptors.
<ul>
<li>Pro tip: buy a DS9093F+ plastic foab to easily plug the iButton out. It's easier to use than the other plastic foab that are supplied in the starter evaluation kit.</li>
<li>Pro tip 2: if you don't have a plastic foab, don't worry, you can just avoid pushing the iButton all the way through, it's possible to just slightly push until the iButton connects to the surrounding metalling ring, that's enough for the software to detect the iButton. Just maintain the iButton in this position with your thumb and release when you're done transferring data and configuring the next mission. This way, the iButton never gets stuck in place, and so you don't need any additional tool to remove it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>download data of previous acquisition (if there is one): Mission tab &gt; Temperature Data Log subtab &gt; right click on chart &gt; Save as .csv file
<ul>
<li>Battery gas gauge app: <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/3/3761.html</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>check the Real-Time Temperature tab that the iButton is working correctly (you can touch with your thumb to check that the temperature changes after a few seconds).</li>
<li>sync button clock to computer</li>
<li>click on the button "Start a new mission":
<ul>
<li><b>0.0625°C temperature precision</b></li>
<li><b>120s (2 min) sampling rate for DS1922L, 300s sampling rate for DS1925L</b></li>
<li><b>Enable rollover</b> (this will overwrite old data when the memory becomes full, this is necessary as I did not find a way to clean up the internal memory before a new mission, it seems File &gt; Wipe the device does not clean the memory, hence without rollover new data won't be saved after 10 days of experiment, even after the data is transferred, see Mission &gt; Total Device Samples count)</li>
<li>Disable SUTA and alarms but enable sampling and set 0 delay (so it starts recording asap).</li>
<li>Click OK</li>
<li>This is what the setup should look like if properly configured:</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24BiologicalMeasures_files/pasted_image.png" width="350"></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deploy (ie, attaching to the body with medical conformable tape such as Hypafix)
<ul>
<li>Orient the iButtons in a top-side fashion, with the top (smaller round side) in contact with the skin and the bottom (wider flat base) in contact with the exterior tape. This is because the top side contains the sensor and the base contains the battery, the latter insulating against fast temperature changes, so the response to sudden temperature shifts is faster with the top-side orientation, as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="this study" class="https">this study</a> shows: "Upon contact with the hot plate, the iButtons with the top side facing the object were significantly warmer for the first 4 min than those with the bottom side against the object (Fig. 3). During exposure to the cold object the ‘top-side’ iButtons were significantly cooler during a 5-min period. We conclude that the top side has a faster response to thermal changes when placed on hard and flat surfaces. The difference between the bottom and top side thermal response may in part have been caused by the locations of the battery (towards the bottom) and the sensor (towards the top)."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Notes:
<ul>
<li>This setup will last about 5.6 days before the internal memory is full on the DS1922L (4096K with higher temperature resolution) and about 212 days for the DS1925L (because limited to 61K recording limit with higher temperature resolution, half of the lower temperature resolution).</li>
<li>The internal battery will last about half a year before the iButton DS1922L is dead and 4 years before the DS1925L is dead. A paper shows <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270579725_Replacing_the_batteries_on_ibutton_Thermochron_Hygrochron_data_loggers" title="how researchers could change the battery manually" class="https">how researchers could change the battery manually</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BESTTUTO for researchers of how to configure parameters (rollover, SUTA, etc): <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/5/5335.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/5/5335.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/5/5335.html</a></li>
<li>Can then disconnect, unstuck the iButton and use Hypafix or Flexifix medical comformable tapes, very comfortable. Interestingly, also advised by <a href="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/using/" title="Axivity for actigraphy" class="https">Axivity for actigraphy</a>.</li>
<li>Placements:
<ul>
<li>axillary = under the armpit, on the arm rather than the trunk to avoid sweat from corroding the iButton (it's not waterproof, only water resistante)</li>
<li>infraclavicular, which means <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltopectoral_lymph_nodes#/media/File:Lymph_node_regions.svg" title="just below the clavicule" class="https">just below the clavicule</a>, check by touching to see if it's warm or reddish which means it's vascularized.
<ul>
<li>Alternative: 1cm above the navel</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>under the elbow or the interior of the wrist</li>
<li>any place on the body that is warm and/or reddish, meaning it's vascularized and radiating body temperature. If it's blank color, then preferably don't use this site.</li>
<li>Medical tape (comformable tape such as Hypafix) needs to be cut large enough (about 2x as large as the iButton's diameter) so that the iButton, placed in the middle of the tape, is entirely covered and also that all sides of the tape are in contact with skin.
<ul>
<li>For good fixation, tape in a cross-shape (2 bands in a cross, one on top of the other) if band too chin (&lt;5cm) or for &gt;5cm tape bands place the iButton in the middle of a 5x5cm square, so as to leave 1cm ("one-half inch") of tape on each side as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160615102653/https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/128297O/tips-for-trouble-free-taping-brochure.pdf" title="recommended by 3M in its &quot;Tips for Trouble-Free Taping&quot; guide" class="https">recommended by 3M in its "Tips for Trouble-Free Taping" guide</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Choose a flat skin surface, without hair, and with little to no deformation on movement (eg, avoid articulations).
<ul>
<li>That is also very important not only for the patch to stick but also for comfort. If properly placed on a flat surface, it should not become itchy even after a few days of wearing continuously.</li>
<li>If axillary (armpit), thy on the arm rather than the trunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If using multiple iButtons, distance them of at least 0.5cm apart so that they're not in contact and do not exchange heat.</li>
<li>Optimal placement sites:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="this study tested on 14 different body sites, and ideal where on limbs + on trunk" class="https">this study tested on 14 different body sites, and ideal where on limbs + on trunk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.20-5-2019.2282879" title="this other study" class="https">this other study</a> shows that wrist skin temperature was shown to be sufficient to estimate the circadian rhythm</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: wrist skin temperature (distal temperature) placement using Velcro to attach the iButton to a cotton sports wristband! + one sample every 10min is very fine! So every 5min is even better!</b> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18761026/</a> : "In our experiments <b>iButtons were programmed to sample every 10 min, and were attached to a double-sided cotton sport wrist band using Velcro®, with the sensor face of the iButton being placed over the inside of the wrist, on the radial artery of the non-dominant hand</b>. <b>The non dominant hand was selected to reduce the potential masking effects generated by the higher activity of the dominant hand (i.e. writing in class, manual working...).</b> This procedure guarantees good skin contact with the sensor face of the iButton. <b>Wrist location was selected among other peripheral regions (ankle, sternum, armpit) after several trials performed in our laboratory, since it allows long term recording without significant complaints of discomfort from the subjects.</b> In addition, subjects could easily remove and replace the data logger when necessary (i.e., to have a bath or shower). After one week of monitoring, the information stored in the iButton was transferred through an adapter (DS1402D-DR8, IDC, Spain) to a personal computer using iButton Viewer v. 3.22© 1992–2005 Dallas Semiconductor MAXIM software provided by the manufacturer."</li>

<li>How to mount and place sensor on body:
<ul>
<li>with strap: <a href="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" title="https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/" class="https">https://corebodytemp.com/coreclips/</a></li>
<li>with patches (may be able to replace with hypafix tape): <a href="https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/" title="https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/" class="https">https://corebodytemp.com/manual/mountingmaintenance/</a></li>
<li>"The preferred mounting site is below the armpit, directly on the rib cage on the are between pectoral muscle and latissimus muscle"</li>
<li>can be combined with Cardiosport strap for heart rate (900+h of battery life!!! + temperature sensor with TP5+ - but memory 16h max): <a href="https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors" title="https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors" class="https">https://www.cardiosport.com/cardiosport-heart-rate-monitors</a> - NO: low quality, uses PPG with green light (when PPG with red light is better and anyway it's not ECG contrary to what they write, it's only heart rate and PPG!)</li>
<li>ALTERNATIVE: according to this brain study, better place where there is soft tissues beneath, not bones, so on solar plexus. Indeed, DHF can acquire temperature 2cm below skin (DHF being the evolution of zero-heat-flux ZHF that consumes less energy): zero-heat-flux sensor for deep sensing of core body temperature if possible on the chest.

<li>BEST TODO: try different body sites, with no bones below but organs (ie, a cavity)? A study shown that placing a zero-heat-flux sensor where there is tissues or organs below provides much more accurate measurements than sites where bones are below the skin. This makes sense since it's estimated that zero-heat-flux method can estimate temperature about <b>2cm below the skin and hence can measure the core body temperature if placed above a cavity</b>.

<li>ECG (heart rate and heart rhythm) + 3-axis trunk Accelerometer: <a href="https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/blob/1d3ff05bccbd3a5ccc00731e941c73285248fa6b/technical_documentation/H10_ECG_Explained.docx" title="Polar H10" class="https">Polar H10</a>. Costs about 80€. Comes with a chest strap. Battery: 16.5 days with one button (CR2320) battery.
<ul>
<li>The Polar H10 sensor needs to be paired via Bluetooth to a smartphone, and an app needs to be used at all times to record the ECG (because only heart rate can be stored on the internal memory). No cloud service registration required, all data is stored locally.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.j_ware.polarsensorlogger" title="Polar Sensor Logger app on Android" class="https">Polar Sensor Logger app on Android</a> to log both the <a href="https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk/blob/1d3ff05bccbd3a5ccc00731e941c73285248fa6b/technical_documentation/H10_ECG_Explained.docx" title="ECG and accelerometer data" class="https">ECG and accelerometer data</a> with the sampling rate of your choice (up to 200Hz/8G for the accelerometer and 130Hz for the ECG). It also saves the Heart Rate in a separate CSV file, and the extra columns represent the RR-interval in milliseconds. The timestamp format is in nanoseconds and the epoch is 1.1.2000. Note that the app only requires bluetooth, hence to save battery, the phone can be set to Plane mode and location can be disabled, everything can be disabled except bluetooth, and the screen can be turned off during data collection. Data is stored in realtime in csv files in the sensorDataLogs folder at the device's root, so that even if the logging is interrupted due to a bug or the device being out of battery, the last logging session won't be lost.
<ul>
<li>It might be a good idea to buy a dedicated <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/battery-test.php3" title="Android phone with a long battery" class="https">Android phone with a long battery</a>, which can allow to continuously record up to 10 days with a single charge (the generated data with accelerometer set to 100Hz and 2G is 400KB/min total for accelerometer+ECG+Heart Rate, so this makes for 6GB for 10 days, or 17GB/month, or 200GB/year of data, so it all fits in any modern smartphone's internal memory).
<ul>
<li>Using as a bluetooth receiver the <b>Realme 6i and its 5000mAh battery</b> (cost about 170 euros), the <b>battery consumption rate is 10%/24h, hence up to 9-10 days can be acquired with one full charge</b>.</li>
<li>Here are the steps to configure the Realme 6i to allow for continuous background task (as otherwise most Android smartphones automatically kill background apps when the screen is turned off) and low battery usage:
<ul>
<li>Enable developer's mode, then in developers options, set Background processes limit to 4 instead of standard limit.</li>
<li>Then in battery optimizations (specific to this phone) disable all except screen optimization and standby optimization.</li>
<li>Disable Do not disturb mode and any night mode, else they will kill apps during the night.</li>
<li>Also activate plane mode, disable wifi, close all apps except ecg and activate only bluetooth.</li>
<li>Finally, open the ECG acquisition app and lock it (tap on tasks button to show all windows then swipe down the ecg app window or tap on the 3 dots in the corner to enable the lock). Then go back to the app, launch the acquisition, then go to the graph tab, check if data is acquired alright and then click on the Pause button at the bottom of the Graph tab to disable graphs and save battery.</li>
<li>Now switch back to the main tab, check if the BPM and accelerometer values at the bottom are dynamically changing, if yes then all is ok and you can switch off the smartphone screen. You need to leave the app in focus at all time, do not switch another app, the ECG need to remain on the foreground to not be killed. Android 11 may fix this issue but for now smartphone vendors are too aggressive with background tasks killing so there is no other way around.</li>
<li>With all these steps done, the Realme 6i and its 5000mAh battery will be consumed at a rate of 10%/24h, hence with a full charge the ECG can be continuously acquired for 9 to 10 days! Which is an impressive feat that currently no other wearable ecg can do. Plus motion noise is greatly reduced thanks to the Polar chestband without dangling electrodes wires.</li>
<li>The data will be continuously saved in CSV files in the sensorDataLogs folder, even if the app or phone crashes at some point.</li>
<li>The Realme 6i needs of course to be kept within bluetooth range (ie, it can go through 2 thin walls but not the distance of a full apartment), so buying a <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B081BJRHK2" title="small shoulder bag for smartphones" class="https">small shoulder bag for smartphones</a> to carry the Realme 6i at all time on oneself is recommended. Example of a smartphone shoulder bag:</li>

</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternative to get an even longer battery bluetooth receptor: make an Arduino-based bluetooth low energy (BLE = BT 4.0) logger to microsd card. <a href="https://github.com/SensorsIot/Bluetooth-BLE-on-Arduino-IDE/blob/master/Polar_Receiver/Polar_Receiver.ino" title="Some developers already made heart rate loggers for Arduino" class="https">Some developers already made heart rate loggers for Arduino</a> and Polar H7 chest bands (see also <a href="https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=116145.0" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://makecademy.com/bluetooth-heart-rate-sensor-arduino" title="here" class="https">here</a>), but not the ECG, although the SDK is open so that should also be possible to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Using the Polar Beat app, the H10 sensor can be configured to have a dual Bluetooth stream, so that it can send data to two different devices/apps simultaneously. This can be used advantageously to concurrently continuously record the ECG data on one device, and use another device (the day-to-day smartphone) for when you want to visualize your current heart rhythm in real-time. To do this, install the Polar Beat app, pair the sensor, then go to the settings, click on the sensor and the sensor's options will show up, and then you can enable the "2 BLE receptors" option.
<ul>
<li>Using the Polar Beat app, <a href="https://support.polar.com/en/support/How_to_make_the_most_out_of_H6_and_H7_sensor" title="disable GymLink and ANT+ to significantly increase battery duration" class="https">disable GymLink and ANT+ to significantly increase battery duration</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combined with the EliteHRV Android and iOS app, the Polar H10 can be used for breathing relaxation exercises (fundamental resonance breathing etc), and also be used as a biofeedback tool.</li>
<li>Big advantage of this setup compared to others: it really allows for continuous ECG, since there is no need to transfer data to restart a new session, as the phone's memory is used and it's vast. So only the smartphone's battery is the limitation, but it can be recharged while the acquisition continues, and even the data can be transferred concurrently using FTP or similar apps. This is a true 24/7 continuous ECG monitoring setup.</li>
<li>Higher-grade alternatives (but with much shorter battery or storage space):
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vitalsignum.com/en/" title="VitalSignum Beat2Phone" class="https">VitalSignum Beat2Phone</a>, costs 500 euros, uses a chest strap, can record medical-grade 2000Hz ECG on internal memory for 24-48h, and data is exportable from the Android app to a computer directly without any cloud service necessary. Medical-grade device that is certified in European Union to diagnose atrial fibrillation. </li>
<li>Shimmer3 ECG, costs 500 euros, 5-wires 4-leads. Medical-grade ECG using standard wet electrodes.</li>

<li>"Bright light treatment and exogenous melatonin administration are considered to be the treatments of choice for these circadian rhythm sleep disorders. <b>Circadian phase needs to be estimated in order to time the treatments appropriately. Inappropriately timed bright light and melatonin will likely worsen the condition. Measurements of core body temperature or endogenous melatonin rhythms will objectively assess circadian phase; however, such measurements are seldom or never used in a busy clinical practice.</b> This review will focus on how to estimate circadian phase based on a careful patient history. Based on such estimations of circadian phase, we will recommend appropriate timing of bright light and/or melatonin in the different circadian rhythm sleep disorders. We hope this practical approach and simple recommendations will stimulate clinicians to treat patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders."</li>

<li>Denoising: to clean up noise (denoising) of temperature data from home/wild settings, on humans at home and for circadian rhythm prediction:** "In contrast to most laboratory assessments, it seldom happens that field assessments are free of artefacts. Therefore an automated artefact rejection procedure was applied to exclude extreme drops and rises in temperature. Because of the bimodal rather than normal distribution of the temperature data, no artefact rejection was applied to exclude data more than two or three standard deviations from the mean, but rather a three-step nonparametric method. [...] the three-step artefact rejection procedure resulted in far fewer noisy distal and proximal curves, whereas the variability was maintained. Firstly, the rate of change (ROC) of all subsequent single channel data points was calculated, their quartiles Q25 and Q75, and their interquartile distance (IQRROC). Any data point with a rate of change exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very fast drops or increases in temperature. Secondly, in the resulting restricted raw data, the quartiles Q25 and Q75 and their interquartile distance (IQRLEVEL) were calculated. Any data point with a level exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very low temperatures.

<li>Wrist skin temperature can be used to estimate blood pressure patterns!

<ul>
<li>My summary: The idea is to use a sensor for full visible light + same but blue light filtered, so that we can infer directly the intensity of blue-green light exposure which affects the circadian rhythm, contrary to using a color sensor which will be biased and only indirectly allow to calculate the intensity of exposure to blue-green light!</li>
<li>"an algorithm that allows to determine light intensity, timing and circadian light stimulation by differentiating between full visible, infrared and circadian light, as well as to discriminate between different light sources (natural and artificial with low and high infrared composition) in subjects under free living conditions. The ACM device is provided with three light sensors: (i) a wide-spectrum sensor (380-1100 nm); (ii) an infrared sensor (700-1100 nm) and (iii) a sensor equipped with a blue filter that mimics the sensitivity curve of the melanopsin photopigment and the melatonin light suppression curve."</li>
<li>But <b>why do they care about correcting infrared light??? To differenciate between the light source being natural or artificial:</b></li>
<li>"Here, we reported the spatial and spectral ability of a wrist worn ACM device provided with three light sensors that combines full spectrum, infrared and blue light simultaneous monitoring, <b>allowing not only intensity and timing of visible and circadian light exposure to be evaluated, but also to infer light source and thus, differentiate between natural and artificial light exposure</b>." → but no color detection! They only consider blue-green light exposure, but it's sufficient since it's the light that maximally stimulate the ipRGC cells! But using the other sensor we have access to the full spectrum anyway!</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: light sensor on the wrist does not make much difference in terms of detecting exposure to circadian light! (different from full light): "In order to facilitate the usability of the ACM device under normal living conditions, it has been designed to be worn on the wrist, discarding other placements closer to the eyes but much more uncomfortable for the subjects. Although, at first instance, it could be argued that this position could affect the accuracy of lighting measurements, <b>previous studies by Figueiro et al. (2013) have shown that differences in active circadian light exposure are surprisingly small, typically less than 10% on average, when data at eye and wrist level are compared</b>. Thus, light exposure measurement in other places than the eye seems to be also a reliable method when assessing circadian light exposure."

</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL METHODS: technical details about the light sensors: "To record visible light (400–700 nm), a combination of two sensors is used in KronowiseR , one of full spectrum ranging from 400 to 1100 nm and another for infrared light (from 700 to 1100 nm). The combination of these two measures allows, on one hand, to differentiate whether light source is natural or artificial and among these, if light is provided by sources with high or low content in infrared radiation, or by the sun, as those light spectra shown in Figure 6. The circadianeffective light is detected thanks to blue filter covering a second full light spectrum sensor. The selected blue filter shows a transmittance profile to sunlight that is highly coincident both with the spectral inhibition curve of melatonin (Brainard et al., 2001) and with the model of melanopsin sensitivity curve of the ipRGCs (Enezi et al., 2011), letting pass visible wavelengths between 380 and 590 nm and above 680 nm. Thus, the “dose” of active circadian light to which the subject is exposed to can be calculated without inferences from combination of blue and green detectors, as it happens with Actiwatch Spectrum (Cao et al., 2015)."</li>
<li>Comparison between Kronowise, Daisymeter and Actiwatch Spectrum: "To date, and to our knowledge, only two ambulatory devices are available for the detection of visible and circadian light: the Daysimeter (Bierman et al., 2005) and Actiwatch Spectrum (Phillips)."
<ul>
<li>"The Daysimeter, a head-mounted device, has been specifically designed for detecting light exposure, so its performance in this field is very interesting; however, the device only includes an accelerometer and must be placed close to the eyes, limiting seriously its ability to detect sleep and wakefulness states. In addition, and although its light sensor shows a sensitivity curve restricted to the photopic spectrum, it shows a significant drop between 550 and 600 nm, a band to which the human eye is sensitive (Dartnall et al., 1983; Roorda and Williams, 1999)."</li>
<li>"The second device, Actiwach Spectrum, was primarily designed for detecting sleep and wake rhythms (Young et al., 2009; Kripke et al., 2010), and later incorporated RGB detection. This latter consists of three color sensors for light in the long wavelength (∼600–700 nm), middle-wavelength (450–600 nm) and short-wavelength range (∼400–550 nm), which correspond to R, G, B spectral outputs and a broadband “white light” (W) output (Price et al., 2012; Cao et al., 2015). However, its sensitivity spectrum does not match the one for the human retina. It shows a bimodal pattern, with a main peak at short wavelengths and a secondary peak at long wavelengths. In contrast, in the 570–600 nm band, the device is practically non-sensitive. This band, apart from its sensitivity of human retina, is characteristic of discharge light sources such as fluorescent lamps (Figueiro et al., 2013). Consequently, the photometric measurements of these common light sources will be systematically biased with this device and circadian light stimulation must be indirectly deduced from data recorded by blue and green sensors."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Considering that the most powerful zeitgeber for circadian entrainment is the light-dark cycle (Roenneberg and Foster, 1997; Roenneberg et al., 2003), its simultaneous recording with other output signal seems a must to obtain an integrative assessment on the circadian function. In this sense, KronowiseR can constitute a useful and comfortable tool to deep our knowledge on light synchronization effects while people maintain their usual lifestyle."</li>

<ul>
<li>"The devices measured skin temperature at wrist level (WT), motor activity and body position on the arm, and light exposure by means of a sensor placed on the chest. Dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) was used to compare and evaluate the accuracy of the ambulatory variables in assessing circadian phase."</li>
<li>"<b>An evening increase in WT: WTOnset (WTOn) and "WT increase onset" (WTiO) was found to anticipate the evening increase in melatonin</b>, while decreases in motor activity (Activity Offset or AcOff), body position (Position Offset (POff)), integrative TAP (a combination of WT, activity and body position) (TAPOffset or TAPOff) and an increase in declared sleep propensity were phase delayed with respect to DLMO. The phase markers obtained from subjective sleep (R = 0.811), WT (R = 0.756) and the composite variable TAP (R = 0.720) were highly and significantly correlated with DLMO."</li>
<li>"The findings <b>strongly support a new method to calculate circadian phase based on WT (WTiO) that accurately predicts and shows a temporal association with DLMO.

<li>"Circadian aging in humans is characterized by a phase advance, accompanied by rhythm fragmentation and flattening."</li>
<li>"<b>Circadian system maturation was associated with an increase in amplitude and a reduction in skin temperature during sleep.</b> During adulthood, women showed a more robust pattern (lower fragmentation, and higher night-time temperature, amplitude, circadian function index, and first harmonic relative power); <b>however, these differences were lost with aging</b>, a period of life that was consistently associated with a phase advance of the rhythm. In summary, distal skin temperature pattern can be used as a robust variable to discern between different ages throughout the life."</li>
<li>"All adults wore a <b>Thermochron iButton DS1921H (Dallas, Maxim) for skin wrist temperature measurement, which had a precision of ±0.125 °C. This temperature sensor was placed on the wrist of the nondominant hand over the radial artery and isolated from the environmental temperature by a double-sided cotton sport wrist band, as previously described (Martinez-Nicolas et al. 2013).</b> The babies wore the device inside a sock to isolate it from the environmental temperature, as previously described (Zornoza-Moreno et al. 2011). All devices were programmed to sample once every 10 min, and they were worn for three (in the case of babies) or seven consecutive days (remaining groups)."

<li>BEST CRITICAL METHODS: they using Velcro to attach the iButton to a cotton sports band! "In our experiments <b>iButtons were programmed to sample every 10 min, and were attached to a double-sided cotton sport wrist band using Velcro®, with the sensor face of the iButton being placed over the inside of the wrist, on the radial artery of the non-dominant hand</b>. <b>The non dominant hand was selected to reduce the potential masking effects generated by the higher activity of the dominant hand (i.e. writing in class, manual working...).</b> This procedure guarantees good skin contact with the sensor face of the iButton. <b>Wrist location was selected among other peripheral regions (ankle, sternum, armpit) after several trials performed in our laboratory, since it allows long term recording without significant complaints of discomfort from the subjects.</b> In addition, subjects could easily remove and replace the data logger when necessary (i.e., to have a bath or shower). After one week of monitoring, the information stored in the iButton was transferred through an adapter (DS1402D-DR8, IDC, Spain) to a personal computer using iButton Viewer v. 3.22© 1992–2005 Dallas Semiconductor MAXIM software provided by the manufacturer."</li>

<li>Over time this internal clock will drift slightly. For single device applications, that can tolerate a drift of 50 parts-per-million (0.18 seconds per hour) no action is needed. However, when using multiple devices for a single capture session, aligning the data sets from several sources can become difficult. To overcome this, you can add an easily identifiable signal (e.g. claps at the start and end of capture), and tools are available to help synchronize this to an external clock or between devices. <a href="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors" title="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors" class="https">https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/settings/#additional-sensors</a></li>
<li>For single handed monitoring the choice between dominant and non-dominant hand must be based on if the data set will be used for activity classification and physical activity monitoring type applications (for which the non-dominant hand is a popular choice) or finer grained skill assessment of activities (for which the dominant hand is often used). <a href="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/using/" title="https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/using/" class="https">https://axivity.com/userguides/ax3/using/</a></li>
<li>However, for successful data capture the AX3 must be securely fastened to the target with minimal room for vibration, slip or twist; this helps preserve only the motions of the target are captured.

<li>"The <b>circadian rhythm of core body temperature (CBT) is a well-documented physiological phenomenon</b>. Already in 1842, Gierse [6] had shown that his own oral temperature revealed a maximum temperature in the early evening and a minimum in the early morning hours with a maximum-minimum range of 0.9 °C. It had been <b>assumed for a long time that muscular activity (exercise) and digestive processes</b> were the most important factors for generation of the CBT rhythm [8]. Aschoff and his colleagues systematically explored the causes of this rhythm [1, 2]. He showed that the circadian rhythm of CBT is determined both by changes in heat production and changes in heat loss, and concluded that <b>heat production undergoes a circadian rhythm which is phase advanced by 1.2h with respect to the circadian rhythm of heat loss</b>, i. e. when heat production surpasses heat loss, CBT increases – transport of heat needs time. Therefore, <b>when we want to explain changes in CBT we need to know the relationship between heat production and heat loss</b>."</li>

<li>"The neurobiological mechanisms of both sleep and circadian regulation have been unraveled partly in the last decades. A network of brain structures, rather than a single locus, is involved in arousal state regulation, whereas the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) has been recognized as a key structure for the regulation of circadian rhythms. Although most models of sleep regulation include a circadian component, the actual mechanism by which the circadian timing system promotes--in addition to homeostatic pressure--transitions between sleep and wakefulness remains to be elucidated."</li>
<li>"A review of the literature shows that increased brain temperature is associated with a type of neuronal activation typical of sleep in some structures (hypothalamus, basal forebrain), but typical of wakefulness in others (midbrain reticular formation, thalamus). Not only local temperature, but also skin temperature are related to the activation type in these structures. Warming of the skin is associated with an activation type typical of sleep in the midbrain reticular formation, hypothalamus, and cerebral cortex (CC). The decreasing part of the circadian rhythm in core temperature is mainly determined by heat loss from the skin of the extremities, which is associated with strongly increased skin temperature. As such, alterations in core and skin temperature over the day could modulate the neuronal activation state or "preparedness for sleep" in arousal-related brain structures. Body temperature may thus provide a third signaling pathway, in addition to synaptic and neurohumoral pathways, for the circadian modulation of sleep."</li>
<li>"Finally, the model indicates that appropriately timed direct (passive heating) or indirect (bright light, melatonin, physical activity) manipulation of the nocturnal profile of skin and core temperature may be beneficial to disturbed sleep in the elderly. Although such procedures could be viewed by researchers as merely masking a marker for the endogenous rhythm, they may in fact be crucial for sleep improvement in elderly subjects."</li>
