<h3>Foreword</h3>

<br>

<p>
This is a draft of a potential article for a work-in-progress therapy to manage non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD). These procedures have not been vetted by the medical community nor reviewed by the scientific community. Thus, it is NOT recommended to follow the therapeutic procedure outlined in "A new combined therapy", "Stage 1", "Stage 2" and "Preliminary results" sections, as they should be considered totally unreliable. At the time of this writing, this therapy produced little effect to improve the condition. However, the "Introduction" and "Current therapeutic approaches" section can be safely read and provide a review of the state-of-the-art knowledge on this and similar circadian rhythm disorders. Please also note that this text (and the additional bibliographies below) may be partly written in french (the author's native language).
</p>

<p>
This draft was written by Stephen Karl Larroque in 2019.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<br>

<p>
Sleep and circadian rhythm are highly conservated behaviors across all animals, and with some main components such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, also called "master clock", regulating sleep by light (photic) inputs, and having precedence over all other peripheral clocks (Aschoff 198?), such as the pituitary gland which secretes melatonin, or insulin secreted by the liver and temperature modulation in the intestines. These structures are present in all vertebrates[???], which shows they are highly conservated in evolution and are thus serving critical homeostatic functions. Although both of these functions are still under active research to understand them comprehensively, we know that circadian rhythm's purpose is to allow for a living organism to be in synchrony with its environment: to be awake when it's possible to seek food, and to sleep otherwise to recover for the next day. As such, all living organisms rely on these two crucial functions to support their activities. Any disruption, or any abnormal sleep pattern, can therefore only be rare and significantly disruptive as this would cause the living organism to fit less with its environment, and thus decrease its survival chances if we follow darwinian principles.
</p>

<p>
For humans, we know very well how much sleep is healthy depending on age, with diminishing length with increased age [<a href="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" title="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" class="https">https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png</a>]. If the sleep duration is quite well defined, the bed time and wake up time are more variable, with some people being "early birds", others "night owls", and others in-between. These chronotypes can be detected by using questionnaires such as the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire[55].
</p>

<p>
Besides the social isolation and "laziness" stigmata that sleep and circadian rhythm disorders may produce — a persistent myth despite the fact that motivation, alertness and performance are directly influenced by sleep and circadian rhythms[56,58] —, they can lead to several health complications, nearly all stemming from acute or chronic sleep deprivation: from reduction of attention, memory and performance in work settings with only a single night of sleep deprivation, to brain grey matter atrophies and gene modifications[???], and increased risks of accidents[58, ??? hospital workers accidents]. These effects are observed not only during experimental sleep deprivation, but also in settings where there is time to sleep but a shifting work schedule, which represents 15% of all full-time workers in the United States in 2009[59], such as hospital night shift workers [???], firefighters[59], polar antartica expeditions[61], submariners[60] and the NASA Mars Pathfinder and Rover staff[57, 58]. Interestingly, in this latter case, the workers were tasked with following an unnatural 24.65h schedule, to follow martian day-night cycle. The authors report that in 2004, the veteran workers of the Pathfinder mission, described as highly motivated and dedicated to their work, decided in "a rebellion" to stop it <b>after only 1 month</b>, describing the schedule as "broken"[58]. Although the study authors could later setup a strategy to help the workers better synchronize their sleep-wake schedule on the Rover mission, they continued to report an increasing fatigue, hinting at a reduced sleep efficiency despite sleeping theoretically sufficient hours[58]. This goes to show the difficulty for any human being to follow a non natural sleep schedule, with chronic sleep deprivation effects becoming unbearable after only a month, even for highly trained and dedicated workers.
</p>

<p>
Non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD) is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (CRSWD) where the subject experiences a naturally and uncontrollable increasing shift in bed time [44]. It can be diagnosed using various methods with different degrees of precision: from simple sleep logs where the patient simply writes the bedtime and wake up time, to polysomnographs, minimal temperature monitoring and salivary tests for dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).[44] It is also possible to use actimetry, as it was shown to be an accurate enough measurement method.[46]
</p>

<p>
(TODO: add prevalence, risks, genetics, etc on N24SWD or circadian rhythm disorders if not available)
</p>

<p>
Circadian rhythm disorders are complex, as they involve both internal clock mechanisms and external environmental cues ("zeitgebers", which influence on sleep was only relatively recently recognized since 1978[2]). In her landmark paper, De Coursey discovered the Phase Response Curve (PRC), a model of the complex interactions between the internal clock and external cues that was shown to be highly conservated across evolution, across all animal taxons[2]. This curve was first devised for the response to light, but is now also including melatonin, in what is now called a dark-light cycle[??]. This cycle can be succinctly summarized as follows: light stimulation close before sleeping delays the sleep onset (bedtime), whereas light after mid sleep advances sleep offset (wake up time). Melatonin does the opposite: administration close to bed time will advance sleep onset, whereas administration after mid sleep will delay sleep offset. Administration of light or melatonin at any other time during the wakeful phase has little to no effect on the PRC[19].
</p>

<p>
However, although the PRC shape and behavior is conservated in all animals, the exact timing will change between species: nocturnal animals will have their PRC's tau point (the central point of the PRC shape, from which the external cues effects are distributed around — this point is usually at about the mid-time of the sleep phase) during the day, since they sleep during the day, rather than at night. Furthermore, this can change between individuals: some will have their tau value early (the early birds), others later (night owls), and those afflicted with circadian rhythm might have it set during incomfortable times, or even an ever moving tau time for the non 24 free running disorder. The importance of the PRC for the sleep regulation cannot be overstated: it was found that the timing of light exposure relative to the PRC accounted for about 71% of the inter-individual variability of the PRC adaptation to night shift work, suggesting that although the PRC is only one of the sleep regulator mechanism — another one being the sleep homeostasis, regulating sleep pressure, as in Borbély's two-process model —, it is most likely the most important mechanism regulating the temporality/synchronicity with the zeitgebers of the circadian rhythm[25]. Furthermore, interactions between sleep homesteostasis and the PRC were experimentally observed, further supporting Borbély's model[11, 26, 41].
</p>

<p>
It is well known that humans, and nearly all animals, have a circadian phase length tau that is slightly beyond 24h, for humans it's about 24.2 according to NIH[1]. It was repeatedly demonstrated experimentally that isolating a human subject from any environmental cues (including light/dark cycle but also noise and thermal variations, food intake and exercise) causes a loss of entrainment to these external cues and ultimately a desynchronization from the 24h day cycle, causing the subject to revert back to its natural internal clock cycle beyond 24h[1, 2]. In other words, it can be said that humans are naturally non24. The problem lies when there is an impossibility to entrain properly (ie, to be synchronized to the target time) to these external cues, and thus to follow a 24h day cycle. In other words, although anybody can function on a bigger than 24h cycle in the absence of external cues, non 24h can only function in such a way, regardless of external cues. A corollary is that advancing cues (light around wake-up time) and pertinent elimination of delaying cues when necessary (absence of light/increase of melatonin before bedtime) are of paramount importance for any human to entrain to a 24h day cycle.
</p>

<p>
Another source of variability in the PRC shape resides in the magnitude of the response to external cues (ie, the height of the PRC). Not only the magnitude depends on the intensity/dosage of the zeitgeber[43], it also varies inter-individually because of endogenous factors[12]. Furthermore, the response to advancing or delaying cues is asymmetrical: on average, humans have been shown to have a range of entrainment (ROE) — which is the range of day time that one can maintain — to have been estimated between about 23h to 28h[2]. The magnitude is also asymmetrical, with low intensity light suppressing melatonin (and thus producing a delaying effect)[10, last ref], whereas high intensity light is required in the morning to advance the phase[43]. In other words, humans have a much easier possibility of delaying — and living on an extended day longer than 24h — than to advance by reducing their day duration. For instance, to make children sleep earlier than their usual time, it is advised to advance by small increments of 15 minutes[??]. This is also evidenced by the etiology of non-24 disorder, for which only cases of longer days than 24h are known (daily phase delay), and no case of individuals with a too short day (daily phase advance). Czeisler CA hypothesized that subjects with delayed sleep disorder (DSPD) may have an even weaker response to advancing the PRC phase, such that delaying was almost the only possible route. They furthermore tested their hypothesis experimentally on 5 DSPD subjects by devising a chronotherapy involving a tau of 27h for one week, in other words a daily 3h shift, which suggests that indeed DSPD subjects more easily responded to delaying than advancing, similarly to what was observed also in healthy volunteers without a circadian phase disorder (see below), although more studies with randomized trials with a bigger sample size are needed to confirm.
</p>

<p>
As written by [2]: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> <b>This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded.</b> Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that <b>90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route</b>. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance). »
</p>

<p>
Both the inter-individual variability of the PRC[12] and the hyper-sensitivity of DSPD and non-24 to delaying light cues[13] have now been observed experimentally, further supporting Czeisler et al's hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a third source of variability is that the PRC shape is centered around the tau point, the mid sleep time, which is equal to the day cycle duration. Combined with the asymmetry in the PRC shape, this might make an absolute (but not relative) advancing an impossible feat for subjects with circadian phase disorders. For example, if a human is on average able to advance 30 min daily, depending on their own tau, a person might be unable to effetively advance: if the tau is 24.2 (24h and 12 minutes), then the advancing capacity exceeds the natural free running induced by the internal clock ; but if another person has a tau of 25h, with the same advancing capacity, then the maximal advancing capacity is only of 24h30, which exceeds a 24h day schedule, meaning that even with proper response to external cues, this individual cannot entrain to a 24h day, but only to a 24h30 day. Thus, the tau and magnitude of an individual's PRC are mathematically critical parameters for this individual to be able to entrain to a 24h day cycle. And indeed, non 24 free running disorder (N24) and DSPD were both recently shown to have a delayed tau (mean phase duration)[3, 4], confirming one of Czeisler CA et al's hypotheses[2]. Footnote: In the 2016 study, it was found that DSPD had a tau of about 24.5h, whereas N24 had more than 25h. This would suggest that N24 might have as a defining characteristic a longer tau than other circadian rhythm disorders. However, this study had a very low sample size, particularly for N24 which was only of 2 subjects. Furthermore, the 2013 study on DSPD patients only found an average tau of 25h, thus eliminating the apparent (but non statistically significative) difference found in the 2016 study.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, DSPD were shown to have a delayed melatonin profile[18].

Thus, it is ALWAYS possible for a human to delay as well as advance, but advancing is always more limited compared to delaying. The corollary is that humans can modify their sleep onset/offset, simply by letting their natural clock free run.

<h5>Gut microbiota and melatonin</h5>

<p>
TODO: gut microbiota is the major producer of melatonin, melatonin is broken down by the liver, microbiota bacteria synchronized with melatonin (hence melatonin can help with irritable bowel syndrome?), melatonin helpful for liver diseases such as NASH, melatonin mixup with glucose, misregulation of melatonin due to melatonin receptor type 2 mutation and highly predictive of obesity and diabetes and other metabolic syndromes.

<h3>Current therapeutic approaches</h3>

<br>

<p>
Several treatments were proposed for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
The pituitary gland is an important component of the sleep-wake rhythm in humans. It was shown through lesional studies to regulate the circadian rhythm, and hence got the nickname of "master clock".[47] It is influenced by both light and melatonin.[47] In blind non 24 subjects, lesions in the pituitary gland have been regularly observed[??]. This led to the hypothesis that this disorder may be caused by dysfunctions in the master clock. Hence, the two most pursued treatments for non 24 so far have been by modulating these two antagonistic signaling pathways, melatonin, the "darkness hormone" which is secreted in the absence of light, and light, which inhibits melatonin secretion.
</p>

<p>
Melatonin has historically been the first line of treatment for non 24 in blind people. It was shown to be effective for entrainment in up to 67% of the subjects.[45] However, since this is a natural hormone that is not patentable, no pharmaceutical industrial went through the process of validating melatonin through national institutions such as the USA Food And Drugs Administration, and thus melatonin is not officially recognized as a treatment for non 24, although there is good evidence this is the case.[44, 45] There is currently only one recognized drug treatment for non 24, which is Tasimelteon (commercial name Hetlioz),[44] with an entrainment rate of 20% in a randomized controlled study, which seems considerably lower than melatonin's entrainment rate.[45] Apart from these two drugs, there is currently not enough evidence for any other kind of treatment or therapies for non 24, according to the 2015 guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).[44, 45] As pointed out by an excellent review, the AASM made their criteria more difficult in the latest revision of their guidelines, so that only treatments with reliably high confidence of effectiveness could be recommended, but that does not mean other therapies are ineffective, simply that there is not sufficient evidence.[45]
</p>

<p>
Light therapy was proposed as a way to advance the PRC. Increase in cognitive performance and attention was noted for night shift workers using a bright light (which definition of bright varies depending on the study) during their shift at night. However, light therapy has shown limitations: light cues have no effect on the circadian rhythm if outside of the PRC curves[19] (ie, only effect is around bedtime and wakeup time, during the individual's wake up period there is no effect), and furthermore sleep pressure can also reduce or nullify the effect of light[21]. Thus, it is important to both time correctly the light therapy according to the individual's PRC curve, and to ensure the individual is properly rested so that the light cue can be effectively processed to advance/delay the PRC.
</p>

<p>
An extension of the light therapy is the corollary dark therapy, which is to ensure that delaying light cues are minimized. Such a dark therapy usually involves either placing the individual in a dark room in the laboratory setting, as is often done to measure the natural DLMO and minimal temperature in order to qualify the circadian rhythm parameters such as its duration tau. Outside of the laboratory setting, experiments attempted to use accessories to help shift workers better adapt to their schedule, with significant success. Blue blockers glasses were shown to be efficient in improving the sleep efficiency and circadian rhythm delaying for night shift workers, and are now formally recommended by health bodies.[20] Although historically most studies have studies either light therapy or dark therapy, their combinations seem nowadays only natural since their complex interactions, by compounding or nullifying, provide an excellent mean to adjust one's circadian rhythm as shown in night shift workers[41].
</p>

<p>
Some have argued that the difference in the circadian rhythm might reflect an adaptation to a different timezone, and thus that moving the individual to a proper timezone would correct the chronotype. However, this was not supported by experiments, where the light exposure and occupation were explaining all the differences in the individuals chronotypes with no to little effect of the timezone.[17]
</p>

<p>
Another approach is chronotherapy. A naive chronotherapy commonly devised by non24 involves building a high sleep pressure by prior sleep deprivation, allowing to sleep at the target bedtime even though it is not in phase with the endogenous circadian rhythm and thus would mostly prevent any attempt to sleep during this high wakefulness period, bar for the high sleep pressure. This strategy is also employed by night shift workers[38, 41]. Needless to say, such strategies have very deleterious effects, not only in the long term, but also in the short term[??].
</p>

<p>
There are however more elaborate chronotherapy schemes that do not involve or limit sleep deprivation. A study on 5 DSPS patients found that chronotherapy was very effective to resynchronize the circadian rhythm faster to the target time by allowing free-running and even furthering the free-running to a higher tau (eg, follow a 27h day schedule instead of the endogenous 24.5h)[2]. All these patients were able to maintain their desired sleep schedules for months or even years after the therapy[2]. Despite the promises shown by chronotherapy in DSPS patients, a few authors raised concerns about the risk of modifying the tau parameter under the effect of artificial extension during chronotherapy[7], which stopped investigations into chronotherapy for circadian rhythm disorders since then. For instance, a case study reported the case of a DSPD patient transitioning to N24 after self-initiated adaptations in his lifestyle to accustom with his DSPD disorder[??]. This led to some suboptimal adaptations, such as practicing sport in the evening/night, which is known to negatively affect sleep efficiency when done this close to sleep onset[??]. This led some authors to argue this resulted in a regularly applied extended delay, ultimately causing a transition from DSPD to N24. This interpretation is arguable, as the patient did not follow a formal and controlled chronotherapy, but rather attempted to adapt his own schedule to his DSPD condition. Thus, the causality might be inversed: instead of the extended delay causing a switch to N24, it could be that the delay was caused by the DSPD transitioning to a N24. Thus, it can be debated whether these adaptations were caused by the DSPD condition, and whether a more appropriate and controlled chronotherapy would have instead enhanced his condition instead.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, these criticisms raise a new concept that was seldom, if never, studied before: <b>the possibility to change the tau parameter (by reduction/advancing or by expansion/delaying) via a behavioral therapy. </b>This concept can be further extended to any zeitgeber based therapy, and the question be more generally reframed as following: is the effect of zeitgebers cumulative over time, or is it fixed relatively to the baseline circadian rhythm?<b> We name this the hypothesis of cumulative zeitgebers effects on the circadian period tau</b>. In other words: would forcing oneself to live longer or shorter days than the innate internal clock eventually lead to the internal clock adjusting to the new daylength?
</p>

<p>
Depending on the existence of this cumulative zeitgebers effects on the circadian period tau, two very interesting scenarios are possible:<br>
<ul>
<li>Either zeitgebers do not have a cumulative effect (ie, the tau parameter cannot be permanently changed),
<ul>
<li>in which case chronotherapy and other zeitgebers are a safe way to move faster the sleep onset/offset and partially resynchronize with a desired schedule, thus increasing drastically the patient's quality of life by allowing some degree of control over the disorder. In practice, this would allow such an individual to reduce the timespan with a very incomfortable sleeping schedule by increasing the delaying step (eg, sleep 3 hours later than the day before, instead of the usual 1h for an individual with a 25h cycle, to "skip" dephased days faster) ; as well as increase the timespan in a desired sleeping schedule by advancing the PRC daily during this period (eg, sleep 30 minutes earlier everyday compared to the day before, such that an individual with an usual 25h cycle would live on a 24h30 cycle instead — dephasing only by 30 min daily instead of 1h, thus doubling the time spent in the range of the desired sleeping schedule).</li>
<li>but then zeitgebers only have a fixed maximal capacity of phase delay/advance, which means that extreme cases of N24 or DSPD can likely not sufficiently phase advance to reach their ideal sleeping time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Either there is a cumulative effect, and hence the tau parameter can be changed, in which case:
<ul>
<li>delay chronotherapy might worsen circadian rhythm disorders such as DSPD into N24, as delaying might progressively extend the tau parameter and thus worsen the condition[2,35], studies showing that bigger taus are associated with worsened quality of life in circadian rhythm disorders [??]. But such adverse effects would also be reversible, perhaps at the cost of more stringent and uncomfortable sleep controlling measures, but still they would be reversible.</li>
<li><b>and more importantly, advance chronotherapy might be a potential curative treatment for circadian rhythm disorders</b>: although arduous since the range of entrainment and effect for advancing is more limited in humans (max 1h, but usually much less), daily advance in the PRC would eventually result in advancing the tau parameter to the desired value, closer to 24h. This would be the only mechanism known to durably reduce the circadian rhythm cycle.</li>
<li>The population that might suffer from non24 might be much wider than previously thought, as non24 may be behaviorally caused in this scenario. Indeed, if the tau parameter can be behaviorally or chemically changed, combined with the well-known fact that human's circadian rhythm is naturally above 24h and thus free-running, this would suggest that anybody could potentially acquire the non24 syndrome under specific conditions. Contrarywise, previous studies on variable night shift work found that some chronotypes, mostly the early birds, have more difficulties adjusting to changes in their sleep schedule[15, 27, 38]. A few studies on the NASA personnel explored the possibility to enforce a non24-like free-running schedule of 24.65 hours for 78 days, in order to assess the potential impact of future human cosmonauts who would go on a mission to Mars. These studies found that most of the personnel had major difficulties adjusting to this new schedule, with inefficient sleep even past the 78 days. Other studies simulating the adaptation to a martian days of 24.65 hours interestingly found that some participants could adapt to a non-24 hours day schedule, whereas others could not[65]. These studies however did not assess the initial chronotype of the participants[22, 23]. Indeed, it's known that the early bird chronotype might be partially determined genetically[63]. All of these preliminary evidences combined suggest that, in the case that the tau parameter is modifiable behaviorally or chemically, genetic mutations and predispositions are probably another contributing or discontributing factor to acquire non24. The early bird genotype might be a barrier preventing free-running and proper synchronization to zeitgebers, much like a genotype of zeitgebers hypersensitivity would on the contrary facilitate non24 acquisition by essentially making these subjects more susceptible to environmental factors[12, 13, 25, 28]. Furthermore, other genotypes may innately produce an increased tau, just as much as, in this hypothesis, behavioral adaptations might also delay the tau enough for entrainment to a 24h cycle being outside of the ROE[32]. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to modify the genotype by inducing genetic mutations[65, ??], hence specific lifestyles might induce genetic mutations causing or worsening circadian rhythm disorders such as non24. Thus, it is conceivable that there is a two-way interaction between genetic mutations and behavior/lifestyle, both influencing each other. And actually, these complex interactions between environmental and endogenous factors have already been suggested to explain the difficulties in adaptation of night shift workers[15, 41]. Further studies on these interactions might yield extraordinary insights into the physiopathology of circadian rhythm disorders.</li>

</p>

<p>
Despite the focus of most studies on the master clock, there is evidence that the sleep-wake rhythm is dictated not only by the master clock but by several pathways in the peripheral nervous system (ie, in the whole body).[47, 48, 49, 50] Indeed, there are several evidences of the implication of mistimed food intake impacting the circadian rhythm[51], which can in turn influence insulin sensitivity[52], and even the composition of the diet can cause disruptions in the circadian rhythm[53]. This can have dire consequences, as mistimed sleep, without direct sleep deprivation, can increase the risk for various metabolic diseases such as diabetes and even alter the human transcriptome. (TODO: extend and add refs, process refs in [54]).
</p>

<h3>A new combined therapy</h3>

<br>

<p>
Leveraging the natural tendency of humans to delay more easily, we here propose a new combined therapeutic strategy, aiming to at least enhance the individual's quality of life by teaching how to exert more control on the sleep schedule, while minimizing or avoiding altogether sleep deprivation, which can have lasting effects from the very first night of sleep deprivation[??]. This strategy involves both a chronotherapy to allow the subjects to learn how to exert some control on their internal clock, as well as ... therapy (luminotherapy, dark therapy, sound therapy?) to control external cues as needed, as well as self reporting using computerized tools to help the user both track and also follow through the whole process.
</p>

<p>
This strategy allows to test the two hypotheses of the tau adaptation, and get benefits in either cases: at worst, if the tau parameter cannot be changed, the strategy allows the individuals to exert more control on their PRC and thus sleep phases and quality of life via an individually adapted chronotherapy and sleep hygiene ; at best, it allows to reduce or might even eliminate the circadian rhythm disorder by progressively reducing the tau parameter until it gets closer to 24h to allow entrainment.
</p>

<p>
The strategy involves two stages:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>control of internal clock by extending/delaying the PRC (chronotherapy) + elimination/reduction of potentially influencing external cues → see chronotherapy below.</li>
<li>stabilizing the internal clock by avoiding extension/delaying of the PRC + restoration/simulation of external cues as needed to complement the target PRC</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Such a combined therapy was suggested as a very promising approach to investigate[2, 15], however it was never done before to this extent and data is lacking.
</p>

<p>
All the calculations below will use the wake up time as the reference point to estimate the DLMO and the circadian rhythm of the individuals, which was found to be an accurate proxy for the DLMO, contrary to the bedtime which was not predictive of the DLMO in healthy volunteers[6, 14]. Furthermore, we will not follow current recommendations of various health organizations about the timing of melatonin administration, as they were shown to be ineffective, but rather use the latest evidence from research experiments:
</p>

<p>
«Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.»[16]
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, moving the participant's sleep schedule directly to the target sleep schedule at once has been shown to be not only ineffective, but also harmful by causing sleep deprivation. In effect, although the participant might forcefully wake up at the required time by using a device like an alarm clock, the circadian rhythm will behind the walls slowly drift in a free-running fashion until attaining the target time, meanwhile the desynchrony between the sleep schedule and the internal circadian rhythm decreasing the sleep efficiency as evidenced by polysomnography and ultimately sleep deprivation, as observed in both normal sleepers and non24 patients[2 with footnote 36 and footnote 37].
</p>

<p>
TODO: justify using literature on dsps and night shift work disorder: sighted non24 is very rare or misdiagnosed so litterature sparse, it is arguable whether all circadian rhythm disorders have shared mechanisms, with hints indicating that's true because melatonin work for all and sleep is a very conservated mechanism so likely it's a very stable process throughout evolution with some inter species and inter individual variability.
</p>

<h4>Stage 1</h4>

<br>

<p>
Before starting the Stage 1 of this protocol, it is crucial for the participant to both get diagnosed properly by a specialist physician in circadian rhythm disorders, and to rest properly for at least 2 weeks by following his/her own sleep schedule. The latter might not be as easy as it sounds: chronic sleep deprivation causes a decrease in cognitive performance that is not perceived properly by the subject, which means that subjects that are sleep deprived, which is a common occurrence for persons with the non24 syndrome, will have more difficulties to know when they need to sleep and how  to adapt their behavior to help inducing sleep (which is a big part of the Stage 1 process).[24, 29, 31] Hence, a period of stabilization in the sleep schedule (in the sense that the natural free-running sleep schedule is following to the participant's needs) is essential for the proposed therapy to have any efficiency. This "pre-protocol" period can be advantageously used to order the necessary equipment as well as put in place good practices such as systematically maintaining a sleep log with the help of applications such as Sleepmeter (more about that below). Also, participants should be cautioned that they may be left in a worse condition if they do not follow through the whole protocol (stages 1 and 2).
</p>

<p>
time management is crucial, but more difficult even for night shift workers: «It is common to feel like there is too much to do and not enough time, especially when working the night shift. Prioritize your sleep by blocking off that time first, then determine what else must get done, assign a time for those activities, and delegate or postpone other tasks. We do not routinely decide to pull all-nighters when working days; working nights is not the time for it either. Sleep should not be an afterthought.» <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a>
</p>

<p>
Stage 1: Delaying phase chronotherapy to reach the target wake up time: The chronotherapy involves an alternating strategy on 2 days, for 8 days:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>delay on day 1: extend the sleep onset by 3 hours (ie, sleep 3 hours later than the usual, or can calculate 4h subtracted from the sleep offset/wake up time if this one is more stable). Sleep as much as optimally needed to feel rested (X hours), and wake up at the new wake up time W. Eg: usual sleep time is from 5am to 1pm, on day 1 the new sleep time will be from 8am to 4pm (optimal sleep time of 8h), but the individual wakes up at 3pm instead (and sleeps less than the optimal 8 hours).</li>
<li>stabilize on day 2: sleep at W-X=O time until W time. Eg: the individual will sleep from 7am to 3pm, effectively having delayed by 2h.</li>
<li>Adjust and repeat for all subsequent days, and write down the time in a sleep log after each day. Adjusting consists in reducing/extending the delay depending on sleep efficiency:
<ul>
<li>if take time to sleep then too early, O time should be delayed.</li>
<li>if having too many nightmares (indicating more REM sleep than non-REM sleep), or wake up too early, then slept too late. O time should be advanced.</li>
<li>Hint: the temperature minimum is attained at the mid sleep time, thus when the individual is feeling colder, this might be a good hint that the PRC shape has begun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop this stage when the individual reaches a wake up time close to the target wake up time, with enough margin to account for a few days of continued delays. For this experiment, we advised 4 days of margin. Eg, if the individual's tau before the stage 1 was 24.5h, thus 30min delay each day, and the target wake up time was 9.00am, the stage 1 should stop when the individual wakes up at 7.00am, to allow for 4 days of delaying before reaching 9.00am. During this period, stage 2 will be started in order to attempt to maintain the individual's circadian rhythm in this phase. The number of days of margin can be adjusted depending on the amount of margin one wants to leave in order to adjust to stage 2.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
FIGURE 3: summarizing stage 1
</p>

<p>
During the application of the chronotherapy, it is essential to control a maximum of external parameters:<br>
<ul>
<li>At wake-up:
<ul>
<li>turn on bright lights (use a neon of white light — not yellow — for extended time and/or use luminotherapy lights for short time just after waking up)</li>
<li>Can take melatonin supplement to help delay further (although the effect might be paradoxical — it may not delay but advance, the effect of melatonin might be desynchronized compared to light in circadian rhythm disorders, this is a hypothesis advanced by some authors and there is currently no evidence in favor or against it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before (1-2h at least) bedtime:
<ul>
<li>use blue and green light blockers glasses 2h before the planned sleeping time (such as Uvex Skypper S1933X or Uvex S0360X Ultra-spec 2000 [8] — it is also possible to precisely measure the light stimulation by using a spectrometer or new consumer-grade devices such as the Lys[9]).</li>
<li>stay in a place with minimum to no light intensity. Even with blue and green light blockers, the light intensity can still impact the circadian rhythm. Indeed, it was shown that even lux as small as 2-3 (candle lit dinner) suppress melatonin production [10].</li>
<li>avoid using electronic screens (except ebook readers with einks and no backlight). If really needed, set the backlight to the minimum, and use apps to turn the colors red, such as Twilight on Android. Any screen filter software that does not totally turn all colors to reddish is not filtering enough.</li>
<li>use an eye night cap to block a maximum of light during sleeping</li>
<li>go out of bed and do not go to the bed until it's the planned time to sleep (avoid working from bed! If you can't sleep, go out of your bed and come back half an hour later)</li>
<li>use noise blocking ear plugs during sleeping</li>
<li>turn off any sound or vibration notifications from phones and such</li>
<li>avoid practicing sport before bedtime, prefer to practice after waking up, during the first part of the (relative) day.</li>
<li>eat early at least 3h before bedtime, including beverages like coffee[30] or sugar drinks.</li>
<li>Other advices can be found in: <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The maximum efficiency of this chronotherapy is a delay of 12h under 7 days (the 8th being for the final stabilization, which then should be followed by the strategy's stage 2, which is simply the continuation of this stabilization).
</p>

<p>
However, this efficiency can only be reached if the subject's internal clock can be entrained to a 27h day. DSPD patients were shown to be able to partially entrain[2], however, they did not fully entrain as shown by the reduced sleep efficiency in one of their subject towards the end of the chronotherapy delaying phase they used. In such a misentrainment case, the internal clock will revert to its natural tau[2] (eg, 24.2h in humans on average, for non-24 the delay can be longer from 0.5 to 1h30/day usually), thus a delay will still occur but reduced, which will in practice result in a reduced sleep duration, less efficient sleep and interruptions in the sleep (eg, waking up earlier than intended)[2]. However, when inducing an increased delay shifting, the free-running circadian rhythm might be bigger than the endogenous free-running rhythm without induction. For instance, in night shift workers, who were otherwise normal sleepers and thus probably with an average tau around 24.2h, it was observed that on average the circadian rhythm shift was about 1h, which would be a tau of 25h[41]. Our strategy tries to reduce this issue by allowing an alternating day of stabilization, whereas [2] chained the delays. It is also possible to adjust the number of delay hours by reducing it until the sleep efficiency is not impacted anymore.
</p>

<p>
Alternating days of delay and stabilization further provide a safeguard against the possibility of permanently extending the tau: by stabilizing, we try to ensure that the internal clock does not register the extension of tau as permanent but only as transient, as this was one of the raised concern about chronotherapies in circadian rhythm disorders[7].
</p>

<p>
For writing the time in a sleep log, we advise to use Sleepmeter Free combined with the Sleepmeter Widget by Squall Line Software[5], which are free tools on smartphones that simplifies the maintenance of a sleep log, with the additional benefit of being very precise: instead of writing the time at which you retrospectively think you went to sleep and woke up, the subject can simply tap a widget on the screen when going to sleep and when waking up. The software will then delimit the sleep times, with optionally a calculation of some offset time (eg, if the subject is a slow sleeper and takes 30 min before sleeping, or is drowsy in the morning and takes 20 min to wake up, it is possible to set up the software to automatically add or subtract such amount of time automatically from the "widget tap" times). Using such a software will allow the subject to both more precisely track its own sleep duration, timing and quality, but also provide an incentive for continuing the therapy (increasing therapy compliance). This can furthermore provide valuable data to the physicians and researchers, as sleep log data was shown to be highly predictive of the PRC, allowing to model it with 90% accuracy from sleep logs alone[6]. The digitalization of sleep logs also show great promise to allow for large-scale sleep data acquisition for scientific studies, as well as provide automated health guidance for the individual[62].
</p>

<p>
Napping was suggested to be advised to help in adaptation to zeitgebers by reducing sleep pressure and increase clock susceptibility to light[11], however this was not experimentally tested and there is evidence that napping reduces the sleep pressure and sleep duration during the bedtime sleep, making it more difficult by reducing sleep efficiency because of a lack of sleep pressure and slight sleep debt, which would otherwise ease falling asleep at the planned time[26, 39]. Also napping does not allow to cycle through all sleep stages in the same way that a full night of sleep does[40]. Furthermore, DSPS were found to have slower sleep pressure buildup compared to normal sleepers, and one can probably safely assume the same holds true for non24[15]. We thus disadvise napping in this phase unless required because of too much sleep deprivation (eg, because of a daily shift too big, in which case it should be reduced to allow for easier entrainment).
</p>

<p>
In any case, shifting might produce a more chaotic sleep schedule, as the forced behaviorally-induced shifting might not always be followed by a concrete shift in the circadian rhythm depending on various factors[33]. The participant should thus be prepared that this stage 1 might not be followed by a daily result, but should not be detracted from the overall result that the induced shifting produces (ie, the shifting should in the end be overall faster and allow the reaching of the target wake up time faster than by following the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm). In the worst case scenario, the participant will simply shift according to the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm, but at best, and with the help of environmental cues control such as light, the shift will be faster when following this protocol.

<h4>Stage 2</h4>

<br>

<p>
Stage 2: environmental cues control and melatonin administration to advance phase<br>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B12 cyanocobalamin 1000mcg once per day, everyday (eg, Solgar brand). Vitamin B12 was shown to resolve a few sighted non24 cases and allow entrainment to a 24h schedule[55]. More recent studies evidenced a potential mechanism for this effect, with the B12 potentiating the magnitude of zeitgebers effects on the PRC (ie, B12 allows both light and melatonin — whether endogenous or exogenous — to have more shifting effect — whether advancing or delaying — on the circadian rhythm)[34].</li>
<li>For melatonin administration: use 1 pill <b>every few days (not everyday)</b> of <b>instant release</b> melatonin, dosed at 1.9mg. Instant release is VERY important. More details:
<ul>
<li>The optimal time to take the medication should be at the DLMO point - 4 hours[15]. To calculate the DLMO point = melatonin at wake up time - optimal sleep duration - 2 mod 24 [14]. Eg, if wake up time is 9am and the optimal sleep duration is 8 hours, the DLMO point will be at 9-8-2 = 11pm. From there, the optimal melatonin administration would be at 11-4 = 7pm. In practice, the melatonin should be taken between the optimal melatonin point and the DLMO, thus between 7pm and 11pm in our example, but NOT before 7pm (the melatonin point), as then the melatonin would have little to no effect before this point in the PRC phase.</li>
<li>Note that the bedtime, and DLMO, should not be calculated according to the target bedtime the subject would like, but rather, as suggested in previous reviews, according to the usual/expected bedtime if the subject follows the endogenous freerunning rhythm. The idea is to use melatonin as a tau shortener, in other words to advance the bedtime, and thus it should be adapted to the actual bedtime and not the wished one.</li>
<li>In this protocol, the melatonin administration is NOT daily, but every few days as required: when the individual uses melatonin at the optimal point (or close after), the PRC will be advanced. There is no currently available model that can predict the amount of advance that will thus be effected to any individual, but it can amount to less than a hour to several hours. Thus, the individual should take the melatonin when required to stay in a "range of target times": if for example the target time is to be awake by 9am, and the melatonin advance the PRC by 2h with a single dose, then the individual can take the melatonin when the wake up time gets close to 9am, to shift back to 7am, and then refrain from melatonin administration for a few days until the individual's circadian rhythm gets gradually close to 9am again. This way, the individual will always wake up between 7am and 9am, by using melatonin administration only when necessary. We also suggest this might also have the beneficial side consequence of avoiding habituation lessening effects that might happen with continuous administration of melatonin. If done properly, the wake up time should be irrespective of the bed time, although the individual should feel more sleepy earlier than the days prior, following melatonin administration.</li>
<li>TOADD (rewrite): about the dosage, melatonin was shown to work for some individuals with as little as 0.5mg</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
or even 0.05mg I think<br>
it's mentioned in the current AASM guidelines, and before I have read the original paper<br>
so this suggests that the dosage does not matter<br>
I used to take 5mg at  first, then 3mg, now I use 1 or 1.5mg and it works just the same<br>
nowadays I just use whatever is commercially available<br>
the only thing you want to make sure is to use an instant release melatonin<br>
not a "long release"<br>
because you want it to trigger your sleep mode<br>
yes I did not know that for a long time, it was my physician who told me and now that I did a more thorough review of the scientific literature and what is known about sleep and circadian rhythm, it makes perfect sense<br>
if you take a long release melatonin, it won't help much to go to sleep at the time you want, and in the morning you will feel more sleepy, because the melatonin will still be in effect<br>
long release melatonin is for those who take it as a relaxant<br>
(and I used both before knowing about the difference, and I can confirm, the long release ones do not work for us)
</div>
<ul>
<li>use night cap when you sleep</li>
<li>use blue blocker glasses 3 hours at least before you go to sleep [20]</li>
<li>use auditive blockers when you sleep</li>
<li>as before, control other environmental cues/zeitgebers:
<ul>
<li>eat at least 2/3 hours before bedtime</li>
<li>do NOT stay in bed if it's not to sleep: train your body to fall asleep faster by not staying in bed if it's not for sleeping! behavioral programming</li>
<li>exercise early in your day rather than later and avoid in the 3h before bedtime</li>
<li>avoid drugs, including alcohol</li>
<li>stick to your sleeping schedule: be rigorous with your sleeping schedule and hygiene: remember it is likely you have more sensitivity to delaying effects, thus you should be particularly careful to avoid anything that can delay your sleep (eg, evening/night time social events). Note however that social contacts and knowledge of clock time were found insufficient for entrainment, so although these can disrupt the sleeping efficiency, they are not sufficient to stick to a sleeping schedule[60].</li>
<li>avoid watching moving images (ie, videos) before sleep, prefer reading on an e-ink ebook or at worst a smartphone screen with a reddish screen filter and minimal backlight (ie, Twilight app on Android). Avoid using a laptop screen. Indeed, laptop screens tend to backlight more lux (ie, to project more light) compared to a smartphone, because a smartphone's screen is smaller and also for energy economy reasons they tend to allow a lower amount of intensity at the minimal setting than do laptop screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RECORD your sleep log with sleepmeter, including inputing when you used an accessory (night cap, blue blocker, etc)</li>
<li>Optional: expose yourself to bright light (lux &gt;= 3000) in the 4 hours following wake-up to induce more phase advance[43]. If your wake up time is during the day, you can expose yourself to sunlight (even if cloudy), but if not an artificial light with the appropriate lux intensity can be used. Note that most artificial lights can only project enough lux for phase advance at very close range. New devices such as the Luminettes are currently investigated to make the use of such artificial light therapy more comfortable and increase the rate of treatment compliance.</li>

<h3>Preliminary results</h3>

<br>

<p>
This section describes work-in-progress results that have not been statistically tested, they are <b>first-hand observations</b> on a <b>single case</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone-based sleeping log solutions may provide a quite accurate ground to predict phase shifts (and thus may help the subject in planning the next weeks or months of sleep schedules).</li>
<li>Accessories (sleep eye mask, ear plugs, blue blockers and blue light filters apps) seem to improve sleep efficiency (TODO: statistical test on difference in sleep length as a proxy for efficiency, else would need an actimeter or polysomnograph with and without).</li>
<li>Time-restricted feeding (skipping evening meal) may increase perceived tiredness at natural time to sleep (which in turns contributes to sleep efficiency). It may also somewhat reduce the phase shift.</li>
<li>Melatonin between 5 and 3 hours before calculated optimal bedtime (bedtime = 8 hours before last wakeup time) seems to have a similar, but stronger effect (to potentiate sensitivity to natural tiredness). It seems to phase advance bedtime, but not wakeup time (ie, the subject sleeps longer, but without any benefit, except as a "sleeping pill" when necessary).</li>
<li>Stage 1 procedure seems to indeed help in cycling faster. But stage 2 does not seem to stabilize.</li>
</ul>

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>

It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells. Also, a study in the journal SLEEP found that just one all-nighter resulted in signs of brain tissue loss. Study researcher Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, said in a statement, “Our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neurodegenerative processes.”<br>

[36]: BEST: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>

His sleep efficiency was only 19.5% on night 51, rising to a mere 41.6% on night 52, notwithstanding the significant level of prior sleep deprivation at that point. This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities. Such sleeplessness even under the favorable laboratory conditions of quiet isolation and absolute darkness verifies his reported difficulty sleeping at those desired hours.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>

Sleep pressure concept from experiment: Dijk and Czeisler,1995 - but poorly understood, lacking data.<br>
Sleep debt stems from Borbely's work, or more precisely a homeostatic debt initially termed.<br>
Essentially, Borbely's model is that there are two sleep phases: the circadian sleep phase, modelled by the PRC, and the homeostatic sleep phase. The interaction of both is modelled by Borbely's. But the homeostatic sleep phase is poorly understood, apart from the fact that sleep deprivation, in other words a higher sleep pressure, leads to a lowered response to light. Thus, the sleep depriving strategy to resynchronize is not appropriate, and even reduces the chances in succeeding a delay shift.

There are thus lots of complex interactions in various processes pertaining to sleep, it is not simply a single process. Hence, there are lots of parameters, which interactions and effects are not entirely elucidated to this day, but we have already good evidence to think that they are useful for sleep regulation and potentially control.

Figure 2: «In an individual with DSWPD (B), DLMO occurs later than in a normal sleeper (A) and is potentially influenced by hypersensitivity to evening light, increased evening light exposure, and decreased morning light exposure. A delay in the phase of the circadian pacemaker and sleep-wake timing has been reported in patients with DSWPD, manifesting as a longer interval between CBTmin and sleep offset time, compared with normal sleepers (A). [...]  In healthy sleepers, the temperature minimum during sleep occurs w2 hours before sleep offset, whereas in DSWPD the temperature minimum has been reported to occur w4 hours before sleep offset.»<br>
BEST: DSPD have slower homeostatic sleep pressure buildup, they feel less. «Based on this association, dysregulation of the homeostatic sleep process may be an underlying mechanism that contributes to later sleep onset times in patients with DSWPD. As shown by Uchiyama and colleagues,56,57 sleep propensity during wake differs between patients with DSWPD and controls following sleep restriction, with patients with DSWPD accumulating homeostatic sleep drive at a slower rate compared with controls. In combination with slower homeostatic sleep drive accumulation, it has also been theorized that DSWPD symptoms may be influenced by slower dissipation of sleep pressure. Studies have reported that patients with DSWPD have longer habitual total sleep times compared with normal sleepers.»<br>

Melatonin advances the circadian timing of EEG sleep and directly facilitates sleep without altering its duration in extended sleep opportunities in humans. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246</a><br>
<b>BEST: melatonin optimal administration timing: «4 hours before DLMO induces a maximal phase advance</b> (Fig. 3C), whereas melatonin administration 12 to 15 hours after DLMO or up to 4 hours after waking is reported to induce maximal phase delays.80 A meta-analysis conducted in 2010 by Geijlswijk and colleagues81 investigating the efficacy of melatonin for DSWPD indicated that, compared with placebo, melatonin treatment advances endogenous melatonin onset by, on average, 1.18 hours, decreases SOL by 23 minutes, and advances sleep onset by 0.67 hours. Although this meta-analysis did not take dosage of melatonin into consideration, others have shown that a small dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg is as effective as 3 mg for advancing sleep onset.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884</a><br>
BEST: «Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.» <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" class="https">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135</a><br>
BEST: dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) predicted by wake time and midpoint of sleep, but not bedtime. ME: so wake time (sleep offset) better to predict real bedtime and circadian rhythm than bedtime (sleep onset). <b>«The DLMO occurred about 2 hours before bedtime and 14 hours after wake. Wake time and midpoint of sleep were significantly associated with the DLMO (r = 0.77, r = 0.68 respectively), but bedtime was not (r = 0.36). The possibility of predicting young healthy normally entrained people's DLMOs from their sleep times is discussed.»</b>, The relationship between the dim light melatonin onset and sleep on a regular schedule in young healthy adults., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132</a><br>
<b>NOTE ME: all these parameters can be assumed to be on adults with an average sleeping duration of 8h (hence 14h after wake up = 2h before bedtime). Thus melatonin should be administered 4+2h = 6h before bedtime! Totally different from what is prescribed! But more precise calculation since wake up time more predictive of dlmo would be: time of optimal melatonin administration = (wakeuptime+(24-optimalsleepduration(8h?)-2)-4)mod(24)</b><br>

Summary: DLMO determination through objective measurements from saliva is better to do before treatment to optimize the treatment, but it's less adequate for n24 since it's constantly delaying.<br>
<b>BEST: melatonin levels normal for DSPD except 3h delay and diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion (maybe because of light hypersensitivity?)</b> «DSPD patients had significantly later timed melatonin profiles that were delayed by approximately 3 h compared to normal sleepers, and there were no notable differences in the relative duration of secretion between groups. However, melatonin secretion between dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and acrophase was less prominent in DSPD patients compared to good sleepers, who showed a more acute initial surge of melatonin following the DLMO. Although the regulatory role of melatonin is unknown, abnormal melatonin profiles have been linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease). These results therefore suggest that in addition to a delayed endogenous circadian rhythm, a diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion following DLMO may contribute to the etiology of DSPD.», Nocturnal Melatonin Profiles in Patients with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder and Control Sleepers., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168</a><br>
BEST: «DSWPD patients exhibited 31.5% greater phase delay shifts than healthy controls. In both groups, a later initial melatonin phase was associated with a greater magnitude phase shift», Increased sensitivity of the circadian system to light in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150</a><br>
→ BEST ME: Thus DSPD are more sensitivy to light phase delay shifts (31.5%!), less to melatonin surge secretion, and have slower sleep buildup (maybe due to less melatonin secretion) compared to normal sleepers. Also maybe why strong melatonin with immediate release is better, do not take long release melatonin (useless since duration is not different between controls and dspd). Since the PRC can be asymmetrical, the higher sensitivity to phase delay light (ie, closer to bedtime) gives no indication about light phase advance sensitivity, which might be lower than for good sleepers.<br>

<li>"In one study published investigating the potential hypersensitivity to evening light exposure in DSWPD, patients with DSWPD and controls were exposed to 1000 lux of light 2 hours before the peak in melatonin secretion, and showed a greater suppression in melatonin production in patients with <b>DSWPD (71%) compared with healthy sleepers (56%)</b>.53 Most recently, in a preliminary study by Cain and colleagues54 in which participants were exposed to regular room light (200 lux) for 3 hours before habitual bedtime, greater melatonin suppression was observed in patients with DSWPD (n 5 4) compared with controls (n 5 5) (unpublished abstract)." → not far fetched to think non24 may have the same issue.</li>
<li>+ chronotherapy not controlled, high relapse rate, does not work (it works to delay faster, particularly when combined with ketogenic diet, but not to stabilize): "Prescribed sleep scheduling is used to correct a delay in bed and wake times. First described by Czeisler and colleagues,42 prescribed sleep scheduling involves delaying an individual’s sleep episode incrementally to further delay the patient’s bedtime until reaching the desired bedtime (Fig. 3B). Once reached, the patient is asked to rigorously maintain the new sleep-wake schedule. Although studies in adolescents with subclinical DSWPD75 and case reports have shown positive results,42 there are currently no published controlled trials that have shown efficacy for this treatment approach.76 Findings from one study indicate that prescribed sleep scheduling is associated with high relapse rates,77 whereas another reports the development of free-running CRSWDs in a patient with DSWPD after the sleep scheduling intervention.7"</li>

Low-fat (carb diet) does not help (although it helps with weight loss), I tested for more than a year. Intermittent fasting neither although it helps a bit to nudge forward or backward (not really backward but slow the shift a bit).<br>
Good recent lay public article, keto (low-carb) can help with insulin management, for diabetics and obese (several studies!): <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" class="https">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html</a><br>
If keto works, hypothesis is either that insulin signaling has more impact on circadian rhythm than previously thought, with some people such as non24 being particularly sensitive, maybe in particular it's pre-diabetic non24 people that are more sensitive? Or it can be because of gut dysbiosis, maybe candida albicans overgrowth that is stunted after some weeks of ketosis?<br>
Beware, very low carb may starve bacteria and in fact promote candida albicans overgrowth, because candida albicans has a mitochondria and thus can feed off from ketones, so better to have low carb (not very low)? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/</a> and <a href="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" title="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" class="https">https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/</a> - also this last link explains why too low carb will diminish/disable the immunity system, so actually it's very bad overall ,plus there is no evidence that apart in immunodepressive people, candida albicans can cause any chronic subtle issues (chronic candidiasis, or candida hypersensitivity), it's only proven to cause big issues and only in immunodepressed individuals, so if keto works for some non24, it's likely not because of "starving" candida albicans contrary to what alternative medicine proponents may claim: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" title="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" class="https">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/</a><br>

"Stanford’s Dr. Gardner also says he sees one common misconception about keto: eating too much protein.

"It’s crucial, doctors say, to consult with a dietitian or physician, have cholesterol levels regularly checked, and replenish the fluids and sodium lost by increased urination and the severe restriction of carbohydrates. If not, within two to four days of beginning the diet, that depletion can bring on the “keto flu” — symptoms like dizziness, poor sleep and fatigue in some people." “Carbohydrates have a lot of nutrients that can help us maintain our body function,” said Dr. Prado. On the diet, some people experience “keto breath,” a halitosis likely caused by the production of acetone, which is one of the ketone bodies.<br>

<li>"This study demonstrates how a ketogenic diet strongly and specifically influences the endogenous clock and the circadian physiology of two different peripheral tissues: liver and intestine. Sleep-wake cycle, changes in body temperature, and hormone blood levels are just few daily patterns governed by the endogenous clock. Circadian (from the Latin “circa” = around, and “die” = day) rhythms are involved in sustaining important biological processes and their alteration, such as during shift-work or frequent transoceanic flights, can drastically perturb our physiology and health. Virtually, all the tissues of our body contain an internal clock, which synchronizes the specific tissue physiology to stimuli coming from the external world. Metabolic homeostasis and circadian clock functions are profoundly linked. <b>Time of food and its composition, such as a western high fat diet, has been shown to affect the liver endogenous clock, impinging on its circadian rhythmicity both transcriptionally and metabolically.</b> However, little is known about how the intestinal clock is affected by food and how different peripheral clocks specifically interpret a nutritional stress. [...] <b>Genome-wide analysis showed that PPAR-alpha target genes displayed a specific daily rhythmicity in the intestine upon ketogenic diet. Intriguingly, beta-hydroxyl-butyrate, an important metabolite produced by the activation of the ketogenic biochemical pathway, started to oscillate in the serum and the intestine with the same profile of PPAR-alpha target genes.</b>" <a href="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" title="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" class="https">https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" class="https">https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4</a> and <b>lay public summary</b> <b>BEST: differential effect on intestine and liver, one is phase advanced, the other delayed): Ketogenic diet rewires circadian clock, Claire Greenhill, Nature Reviews Endocrinology</b> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" class="https">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129</a></li>

<li>BEST ME: initial idea back: shortening of tau + phase advance, use anything possible to do that, so can combine food and light for example, maybe multiple zeitgebers control has a cumulative effect?

<li>Postprandial sleepiness (tiredness after eating, particularly at lunch, and particularly with high-carb diet/meal), is attributable to the effect of proteins increasing levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which itself promotes melatonin, the sleep hormone. In addition, carbohydrates help assimilation of tryptophan into serotonin. So a ketogenic diet is likely to increase vigilance, at the expense of mood issues, but may be alleviated maybe by complemeting with 5-HTP complement (but beware of serotoninergic syndrome, which is deadly!).

<li>"There is increasing evidence of a genetic component to N24. In most cases it is not a simple inherited genetic condition (Medelian inheritance). Most patients with N24 do not have parents or close relatives with the condition."</li>
<li>"However, there do seem to be several genetic factors which can predispose someone to the development of N24.</li>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
One study found specific genetic changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in the gene BHLHE40 in 4 patients with N24. As this gene encodes components of the cellular clock, such mutations may affect clock function leading to the abnormalities noted in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
A separate study of 67 N24 patients found an association with polymorphisms in the PER3 gene. PER3 also encodes a crucial component of the circadian clock. The same polymorphisms were associated with extreme evening chronotype – a genetic predisposition to functioning better late in the day, a tendency which is also noted in Non-24s. Variations in the PER3 gene (both SNPs and repeat numbers) are believed to affect free-running period (in animals), the homeostatic drive for sleep (in humans) and the response to light (in humans). All of these factors have been hypothesized, with some evidence, to be abnormal in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
DSPD, a condition related to N24, has been linked to the presence of a mutation in the CRY1 gene, which plays a role in the circadian clock, in a study of one family.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Several genome-wide association studies – genetic screenings of over 100,000 persons — have shown genetic associations with human chronotypes. <b>While these studies did not involve N24 patients specifically, N24 is closely related to extreme evening chronotype, suggesting some of the same genetic factors may be relevant.</b>"

<li>Melanopsin eye receptors: "En 2002, Dr David Berson de l'Université Brow aux USA, a découvert le chaînon manquant des mécanismes de régulation de l'horloge biologique: les cellules ganglionnaires de la rétine interne (devant les bâtonnets et les cônes) contiennent un pigment photosensible appelé ‘mélanopsine'. Ce récepteur nouvellement découvert s'associait parfaitement avec le «spectre d'action» de la lumière bleue. Maintenant que les scientifiques ont identifié la mélanopsine, ils ont pu retracer ses projections via le tractus rétino-hypothalamique au SCN dans l'hypothalamus et d'autres zones dans le cerveau. (1) Cette découverte signifie que les yeux transmettent aussi la lumière mais à travers un système non visuel et les études comparant le système visuel et le système non visuel montrent que la piste de la lumière bleue sur la mélanopsine était non seulement responsable de la régulation de notre système circadien, mais également du système responsable de la vigilance." <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html" title="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html" class="https">https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html</a>

<li>"Des molécules hautement efficaces avec un degré de spécification pour la conversion d'énergie sont connues comme les « photo récepteurs ».  Ceci inclus les molécules photo pigment, comme la chlorophylle qui est importante dans la photosynthèse des plantes. Les cônes et les bâtonnets sont quant à eux les « photo récepteurs » de la rétine déterminants pour la fonction visuelle. La melanopsine trouvée dans les cellules ganglionnaires de la rétine est,  quant à elle,  responsable de la régulation de l'horloge biologique.</li>

D'un autre côté, des molécules non spécialisées qui peuvent absorber la lumière mais qui ne sont pas intégrées à un organe récepteur de lumière sont appelée « photo accepteurs ». Quoique les « photo accepteurs » peuvent potentiellement absorber la lumière, ils font partie habituellement de voies métaboliques qui ne sont pas directement liées avec le traitement de la lumière. Les « photo accepteurs » sont plus abondants et omniprésents que les « photo-récepteurs». Les molécules « photo accepteurs » qui sont capables d'absorber la lumière et d'exercer des changements dans la fonction ou la structure de la cellule se trouvent dans pratiquement toutes les cellules vivantes et pas seulement celles des organes sensoriels spécialisés comme l'œil." <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html" title="https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html" class="https">https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html</a> - low level light therapy (red) - but also used as placebo for blue light devices!<br>
"Les cellules ganglionnaire de la rétine, par exemple, fournissent l'information sur la luminance de l'environnement au système de régulation des rythmes circadiens et règle par ailleurs le réflex pupillaire. La mélanopsine absorbe la lumière via un chromophore rétine-aldéhyde ce qui conduit à une modification du potentiel membranaire via une cascade de signalisation avec des G-protéines. La glande pinéale quant à elle contient la pinopsin, un photorécepteur similaire qui est sensible à 470 nm qui est exclusivement exprimé dans cet organe et non exprimé dans la rétine ou ailleurs dans le cerveau. C'est grâce à la pinopsin que le pacemaker circadien contrôle la production de mélatonine indépendamment des voies visuelles (cônes et bâtonnets)."<br>
" A ce propos, l'hémoglobine semble remporter la palme des « photoaccepteurs » les plus sensibles dans des tissus aussi variés que les cellules neurales, les fibroblastes et les cellules de l'épithélium. Présents dans les globules rouges, on soupçonne d'autres « photoaccepteurs » intermédiaires avec l'hémoglobine notamment la myoglobine et le cytochrome-C oxydase mais aussi le cytochrome-B oxydase, la superoxyde dismutase, l'oxyde nitrique synthase, la guanylase cyclase et les cryptochromes. Ceci se complique par le fait que la correspondance entre une simple longueur d'onde et une cible moléculaire unique n'est pas directe."

<li>"They further indicate that REM sleep, being under strong circadian control, boosts working memory performance according to genotype in a time-of-day dependent manner. Finally, our data provide first evidence that slow wave sleep and NREM sleep delta activity, majorly regulated by sleep homeostatic mechanisms, is linked to working memory independent of the timing of the sleep episode within the 24-h cycle.

<li>"As a result, I cannot work a set time schedule since my sleep cycle is constantly on the move. I cannot predict when I will be awake and when I will be asleep. I've been through treatment but it was not effective, so I'm stuck with this disorder. I would give anything to fix my health, but unfortunately my body won't cooperate. [...] Non-24 makes your sleep schedule unpredictable day-to-day. You might get up 1+ hours later than the day before, but professional and social functions (the ones you don't miss) will interfere with your normal sleep patterns and fragment your sleep. Unlike DSPS, you can't ask for something like a late shift. With non-24, one day might need to be a late shift, another might need to be an early shift, and maybe another you'll be sleeping from 9 AM - 5 PM, all on short notice. [...] The accommodations you want are something along the lines of (a) give me flexibility in the hours that I work; (b) don't confuse tiredness for lack of professionalism; and (c) excuse me from non-essential functions if I am too tired to attend. I think that the current understanding of sleep disorders is too immature to overcome the inherent biases and misguided beliefs of ordinary people when it comes to a conceptually confusing and rare disorder. [...] It may be emotionally draining to explain your disorder, which is probably very private to you, only for your needs to be disregarded. With that said, I think it would be a good idea to disclose this if and when you start getting complaints for sleeping at work, or something related to your sleep.

<li><b>BEST REF biology of melatonin:</b> "<b>Melatonin is synthesized from tryptophan via 5-hydroxytryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)</b>. [...] <b>In humans melatonin is metabolized, ~70% to 6-sulphatoxy melatonin (aMT6s), primarily within the liver, by 6-hydroxylation</b>, followed by sulfate conjugation (with some species variations). A number of minor metabolites are also formed, including the glucuronide conjugate. N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine and N1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynuramine, were initially reported as brain metabolites (1, 16) but have proved difficult to detect in plasma or urine except after administration of exogenous melatonin (17). <b>Exogenous oral fast release</b> or intravenous melatonin <b>has a short metabolic half-life (20 to 60 min, depending on author and species)</b>, with a large hepatic first pass effect and a biphasic elimination pattern (18). Slow release/prolonged release/surge sustained preparations are of course designed to extend the time of high circulating melatonin [e.g., (19)]. It has low bioavailability in general although transmucosal administration increases bioavailability (20). <b>A critical feature of exogenous melatonin with regard to its clinical uses is its very low toxicity and lack of addictive properties</b> (21, 22)." <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" title="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" class="https">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full</a> by Josephine Arendt!!

+ melatonin effect on mood: "Evidence is accumulating that delayed melatonin offset is associated with unipolar depressions,7,71,72,73,74,75 as suggested in Figure 10. The current results indicate that melatonin offset could become delayed due in part to several polymorphisms which delay circadian rhythm systems. Conversely, it is well known that a person's illumination exposure, particularly exposure to bright morning light, may cause melatonin secretion to terminate earlier in the morning, not only because bright light suppresses melatonin acutely, but also because it advances the "morning oscillator" component of the complex circadian oscillator composed of particular cell groups within the suprachiasmatic nuclei.76,77 Morning bright light tends to be antidepressant.78 In general, effects of bright light on mood seem to be mediated through retino-hypothalamic tract effects on the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which in turn regulates the timing of melatonin release from the pineal. Likewise, suppression of morning melatonin by propranolol can be antidepressant.79"<br>

Such a wide distribution is consistent with its multiple and well-described functions which include from the circadian regulation and adaptation to seasonal variations to immunomodulatory and oncostatic actions in different types of tumors.

<li>"Diets are currently characterized by elevated sugar intake, mainly due to the increased consumption of processed sweetened foods and drinks during the last 40 years. Diet is the main source of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). These are toxic compounds formed during the Maillard reaction, which takes place both in vivo, in tissues and fluids under physiological conditions, favored by sugar intake, and ex vivo during food preparation such as baking, cooking, frying or storage. Protein glycation occurs slowly and continuously through life, driving AGE accumulation in tissues during aging. For this reason, AGEs have been proposed as a risk factor in the pathogenesis of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, kidney injury, and age-related and neurodegenerative diseases." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293</a></li>
<li>"Melatonin (MT), an indole formed enzymatically from L-trytophan (Trp), was first discovered in the bovine pineal gland in 1958 by Lerner et al. Melatonin is the most versatile and ubiquitous hormonal molecule produced not only in the pineal gland but also in various other tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This review focuses on the localization, production, metabolism and the functions of MT in GIT and the duodenal unit (liver, biliary routes and pancreas), where multi-step biosynthetic pathways of this indole, similar to those in pinealocytes, have been identified." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638</a></li>
<li>"Melatonin,N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a hormonal product of the pineal gland. Its synthesis is higher at night than during the day in all vertebrates including man. Once melatonin is produced in the pineal gland it is quickly released into the vascular system. The rapid release of melatonin is generally believed to relate to its high lipophilicity which allows it to readily pass through the membrane of the pinealocytes and the endothelial cells which line the capillaries. The result of the nocturnal synthesis and secretion of melatonin is high blood levels at night. Also because of its highly lipophilic nature, melatonin from the blood readily escapes into every other bodily fluid and all cells in the body. Until recently it was generally thought that melatonin's action in the organism depended on its exclusive interaction with specific receptors on cells located in discrete locations. Certainly, the interactions of melatonin with these membrane-bound receptors are believed to mediate the endocrine and circadian rhythm effects of melatonin. It was recently discovered, however, that melatonin's primary action may not depend on the previously described membrane receptors. We have found that melatonin is a very potent hydroxyl radical scavenger; free radicals and the hydroxyl radical in particular, because of its very high reactivity, can be extremely damaging to macromolecules in cells. Compared to glutathione and mannitol, two well known free radical scavengers, melatonin is a more powerful scavenger and affords protection of molecules, especially DNA, from oxidative damage. Melatonin's extremely high diffusibility is important for its scavenging action because this feature allows it to enter all cells and every subcellular compartment. Whereas the free radical quenching activity of melatonin does not require a receptor, we also have evidence that it may be bound in the nucleus thereby providing on-site protection to DNA. Besides scavenging the highly toxic hydroxyl radical, melatonin also stimulates glutathione peroxidase activity which metabolizes the precursor of the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, to water. Thus, melatonin has at least two means to protect the cell from oxidative damage, i.e., it breaks down hydrogen peroxide to harmless water and, in the event any hydroxyl radicals are formed, melatonin scavenges them. Melatonin may be the premier molecule to protect the organism from oxidative damage." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717</a></li>

<li>SUMMARY: MTNR1B expression in carriers of the rs10830963 variant have increases in glucose tolerance when concomittant with melatonin (exogenous). A previous study by the same group has shown that daytime exogenous melatonin intake increased both glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The effect is strong, this genetic variant explains 25% of the variance of glucose profile. Even in normal-weight and nondiabetic participants.

<li>"Genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) have found an association between MTNR1B rs10830963 and increased fasting plasma glucose levels and T2D risk [1, 2, 6]. Follow-up studies confirmed this association with T2D risk [7–9]. However, although the genetic association of rs10830963 with T2D risk is now established, the functional impact of this MTNR1B variant on glucose control is poorly characterized"</li>
<li>"Importantly, among more than 60 variants associated with T2D and/or glycemic traits, the common MTNR1B risk variant rs10830963 had the most significant adverse influence on the disposition index, a product of both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, as estimated by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [12]."</li>
<li>"Despite GWAS have provided robust evidence for an association of the common MTNR1B risk variant with glycemic traits, the magnitude of its effect is small. <b>Notably, all the metabolic assessments in these GWAS were performed during daytime hours when endogenous melatonin concentrations were very low or absent</b> [13]."</li>
<li>"A new approach to investigate the role of melatonin and the MTNR1B diabetes risk variant in glucose metabolism could be to test the effect of exogenous melatonin administration during the daytime on glucose metabolism between carriers and non-carriers of the MTNR1B risk variant. The aim of the current study was to assess whether MTNR1B rs10830963 influences the magnitude of effect of exogenous melatonin administration on glucose tolerance at different times of the day (morning and evening), as compared to placebo administration."</li>

Further interventional studies in shift workers will help to determine <b>whether changing the timing of food intake to avoid concurrent exposure to melatonin can improve glucose tolerance.</b>"</li>
<li>"The strong effect and high prevalence of this genetic variant (MAF: ~30%; thus, 51% are carriers among a population of European ancestry), as well as the common use of melatonin supplementation (over-the-counter or by prescription), make our findings particularly relevant for clinical practice, not only for treatment but also for preventive purposes. Regarding the use of exogenous melatonin, identifying individuals with the rs10830963-G allele may be helpful to provide personalized recommendations about the relative timing of food consumption and melatonin administration."</li>

Lane et al, Diabetes, 2016 : "The risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increased by abnormalities in sleep quantity and quality, circadian alignment, and melatonin regulation. A common genetic variant in a receptor for the circadian-regulated hormone melatonin (MTNR1B) is associated with increased fasting blood glucose and risk of T2D, but whether sleep or circadian disruption mediates this risk is unknown. We aimed to test if MTNR1B diabetes risk variant rs10830963 associates with measures of sleep or circadian physiology in intensive in-laboratory protocols (n = 58-96) or cross-sectional studies with sleep quantity and quality and timing measures from self-report (n = 4,307-10,332), actigraphy (n = 1,513), or polysomnography (n = 3,021). In the in-laboratory studies, we found a significant association with <b>a substantially longer duration of elevated melatonin levels (41 min) and delayed circadian phase of dim-light melatonin offset (1.37 h), partially mediated through delayed offset of melatonin synthesis</b>. Furthermore, increased T2D risk in MTNR1B risk allele carriers was more pronounced in early risers versus late risers as determined by 7 days of actigraphy. Our results provide the surprising insight that <b>the MTNR1B risk allele influences dynamics of melatonin secretion, generating a novel hypothesis that the MTNR1B risk allele may extend the duration of endogenous melatonin production later into the morning and that early waking may magnify the diabetes risk conferred by the risk allele</b>." → early risers = DSPD who try to conform to standard schedule.

Thus, taken together, <b>our data suggest that MTNR1B rs10830963G extends the duration of melatonin production later into the morning, and waking up earlier in the morning magnifies the diabetes risk with MTNR1B genotype.</b>"</li>
<li>"<b>Delayed DLMOff and a longer duration of melatonin in risk allele carriers may result in an increased risk for food intake to coincide with elevated melatonin levels in the morning, leading to decreased glucose tolerance and possibly elevated diabetes risk.</b> Consistently, risk allele carriers with earlier sleep timing have an increased T2D risk, possibly due to concomitant food intake and elevated melatonin levels in the morning. In addition to the adverse effects of an increase in melatonin levels into daytime, a reduction in nighttime melatonin signaling also appears to be deleterious. Reduced nighttime melatonin signaling, either by MTNR1B receptor rare loss-of-function variants (13) or reduced nighttime melatonin levels (5), is associated with an increased risk of T2D."</li>
<li>"The impact of MTNR1B rs10830963G on DLMOff is significantly mediated by sleep timing, suggesting that <b>MTNR1B variation may influence DLMOff through changes in sleep timing or that MTNR1B variation may influence sleep timing through changes in the timing of the melatonin profile</b>. No significant associations with other sleep and circadian traits were observed, consistent with previous studies of narrower scope showing no MTNR1B risk allele effect on self-reported sleep disturbances (41,42)."</li>
<li>SUMMARY: DSPD people who try to wake up (and eat) early (and who most like have this genetic variant of melatonin receptors) are at increased risk of developing diabetes! So skip breakfast, or wake up later. This is one of the risks of DSPD (aside from chronic sleep deprivation). It may be true for anyone eating during melatonin secretion, but delayed from the night into mornings and magnified deleterious effect for carriers of this gene variant as shown in rugby sportswomen study.</li>
<li>IDEA ME: that's why melatonin therapy is not enough, but light therapy at wake up is super important, to inhibit melatonin production (ie, reduce melatonin synthesis duration and thus advance DLMOff).</li>

Based on the new definition of obesity as a chronobiological disease, an unusual or late meal timing represent a circadian chronodisruption, leading to metabolic impairments. Preliminary data from cross-sectional and experimental studies suggest that changes in meal timing can influence obesity and success of weight loss therapy, independently from total energy intake, dietary composition and estimated energy expenditure. A systematic review of observational and experimental studies in humans was conducted to explore the link between time of food ingestion, obesity and metabolic alterations. Results confirm that eating time is relevant for obesity and metabolism: observational and experimental studies found an association between meal timing, weight gain, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus with benefits deriving from an early intake of food in the day in a wide range of individuals. Herein clinical, future perspectives of chronoprevention and chronotherapy of obesity and type 2 diabetes are also provided. In conclusion, meal timing appears as a new potential target in weight control strategies, and therapeutic strategies should consider this contributor in the prevention of obesity."</li>

<li>BEST PROTOCOLS: "Instead, sleep propensity (the tendency to fall asleep) is also modulated by a circadian process. The circadian component (Process C) regulates the endogenous circadian rhythm of sleep-wake regulation across 24 hours1 and is governed by the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN)7. <b>Both processes interact with each other and can only be determined separately by means of specialized protocols such as the forced desynchrony protocol8 or nap paradigms9.</b>"</li>
<li>"When analyzing the circadian impact on sleep propensity under these conditions, the circadian drive for sleep is very low in the early evening before bedtime, shortly before the secretion onset of the pineal hormone melatonin8. At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive, because <b>it implies a high circadian drive for alertness in the evening</b>8–12. Yet, it was shown that the circadian arousal signal in the early evening <b>leads to higher subjective and objective alertness and is thus opposing the accumulated homeostatic sleep pressure</b> - a phenomenon called the <b>‘wake maintenance zone’ (WMZ) or ‘forbidden zone of sleep’</b>5,9,11."</li>
<li>"Cognitive performance, as well as subjective and objective alertness, is also high during the WMZ in the evening15–24. Significant performance improvements of sustained attention occur during the WMZ, both after a normal duration of prior wakefulness as well as after sleep deprivation16. Better working memory performance during the WMZ has been linked to sleep-dependent higher hypothalamic activation as assessed in the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response of the MRI after a normal duration of prior wakefulness, but not after very low or very high sleep pressure conditions25. These studies suggest a differential impact on cognitive performance during the WMZ, depending on the duration of prior wakefulness."</li>

<li>BEST INTRO: "Across species, the drive to maintain a regular sleep–wake cycle is profound. Disruption of the sleep–wake cycle adversely affects an individual's daily performance, safety, and health (Colten and Altevogt, 2006). The public health implications of sleep deprivation (SD) are enormous and include the deleterious health consequences of SD, which is associated with risks for a wide variety of medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression, and compromised immunological function) (Colten and Altevogt, 2006). SD also accounts for 20% of all serious car accidents, which is equivalent to those attributed to alcohol (Connor et al., 2002). Accidents associated with SD are partially attributed to fatigue related performance failures (Colten and Altevogt, 2006). Indeed, SD adversely affects cognitive performance interfering with attention and reaction time (Durmer and Dinges, 2005). This can impair judgment and decision making (Durmer and Dinges, 2005). The mechanisms associated with impaired cognitive function with SD are poorly understood."

<ul>
<li>ME: Thank you VERY much for these studies that nicely complement the one I posted! Indeed sleep inertia isn't tackled in the study, but I guess it's because the setup and goal is different, the nap duration (up to 2h in the study I posted) is significantly longer than in these studies (max 60 min in the third study).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
However, although there is certainly sleep inertia when having a long nap (probably because of going to deep sleep?), the third and even the second study confirm that when one needs to stay awake for a long period of time post-nap, it's better to have a longer nap than a short one.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
If I would submit a hypothesis, I would say that a short nap reduces adenosine levels and the homeostatic process S, but does not produces brain and body repairs as can be done during a full night of sleep, because most of these repairs are done during deep sleep (slow wave sleep SWS), which happens only with longer naps.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So for people who are NOT sleep deprived but feel a bit sleepy, eg after lunch eating because of postprandial sleepiness, then a short nap is more beneficial, but for people who are constantly sleep deprived, slow wave sleep is what is necessary to reduce the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation, and hence longer naps should be preferred.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Note however that in my experience, even long naps can't replace a full night of sleep, I can never sleep as much during a nap however long it is as I can during my natural night. I think the mismatch between circadian rhythm and sleep pressure is a factor that can explain this reduction of sleep duration, and it's certainly not good in the long run, so I'm not advising anyone to just sustain on long naps, but if there is no choice for some days or a period of time, then it's better than just doing all nighters or using wakefulness promoting drugs without a doubt.

<li>"these decrements in performance are exaggerated by prior sleep loss and the time of day in which a person awakens."</li>
<li>ME: So it may not be only the nap duration but also the chronic sleep deprivation AND the misalignment with the circadian rhythm that causes sleep inertia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>BEST: confirmation that chronic sleep deprivation causes sleep inertia</b>: Chronic sleep restriction greatly magnifies performance decrements immediately after awakening. Sleep. 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039</a>
<ul>
<li>"These impairments in performance during sleep inertia occurred after only chronic exposure to sleep restriction and were even worse after awakenings during the biological nighttime. Interestingly, despite differences in objective performance, there were no significant differences between groups in subjective levels of sleepiness during sleep inertia. <b>[Chronic sleep deprivation] worsens sleep inertia, especially for awakenings during the biological night</b>."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT ME SUMMARY: chronic sleep deprivation worsen circadian misalignment at least via 2 known processes: by increasing sleep inertia (ie, difficulty to wake up and sustain high cognitive performance), and by raising dopamine levels and thus countering the homeostatic sleep pressure process S and hence making it more difficult to fall asleep. The combination of both makes it extremely difficult to both fall asleep and wake up at a regular time.</li>

<li>Devices:
<ul>
<li>Ticwris GTS smartwatch
<ul>
<li>My tips: ticwris gts records temperature continously and unattended only when the app LinkTo Sports is launched and bluetooth is enabled, because the watch doesn't store the temperature measurements (contrary to the heart rate which is stored in the watch and uploaded whenever the app is launched). Hence, the app needs to be launched (disable Android's battery optimization to prevent the app from being closed, or "lock" the app to avoid that) and keep it in focus (even if screen is off) and with the "body temperature" records page opened whenever possible (it's not necessary to have the app on focus all the time for the data to be uploaded, but it ensures Android won't close it particularly if the screen is off). Else, if the app does not stay on the "body temperature" records page, the app may be put into hibernation by Android and hence no data will be loggued.  Also, temperature needs to be &gt; 35° (body temperature approximately calculated by the app's algorithm, not the surface temperature from the sensors), else the temperature is not recorded in the app. The surface temperature seems to range from 31° to 36°. Tip: wear the watch the highest possible on your arm, you will get more stable temperature measurements. Note finally there is no way to export the data currently.</li>

Orthosomnia refers to sleep problems experienced by those who are preoccupied with perfecting their wearable sleep data. Over time, such a detailed and persistent focus on improving the data obtained from sleep trackers, creates an unhealthy anxiety about sleep which can lead to worse sleep: the opposite of what the users of these devices are presumably seeking. In some cases, a mild sleep problem has been made worse by the use of sleep trackers, whereas in others, normal, healthy sleep has deteriorated due to this technology.

One study of 61 DSPD patients, with average sleep onset at about 3:00 am and average waking time of about 11:30 am, was followed with questionnaires to the subjects after a year. Good effect was seen during the six-week treatment with a large daily dose of melatonin.

<li>“In our study, we have found that these two devices have comparable effects on sleepiness and sustained attention.Nevertheless, the two devices emit light at different wavelength spectrums and intensity, which can have different physiological consequences. While the conventional LT box used in this study (EnergyLight®) emits a polychromatic white light at 10,000 Lux, the LT glasses used in this study (Luminette®) emits a blue-enriched polychromatic white light, which may exert stronger effects on physiology and behavior. Indeed, the non-image forming effects of light are primarily mediated by melanopsin-based phototransduction with a peak sensitivity of melanopsin located within the blue spectrum. The similarity of the results between LT glasses and box suggests however that <b>polychromatic white light without blue enrichment is sufficient to produce beneficial effects</b>, as previously observed in studies examining melatonin suppression by light. Sasseville et al. also recently demonstrated that LT at the middle of the night (3 am) during 30 minutes at 500 μW/cm² could be as effective with or without the contribution of short-wavelength on subjective alertness and energy, thus suggesting that direct non-image forming effects of light are also mediated by rods and cones. Our results are consistent with those of Sasseville et al., as we didn’t show differences in our study between white polychromatic LT (Philips) and blue-enriched LT (Lucimed): thus, bright light therapy produces its effect non solely via melanopsin pathways. However, two hours after LT, vigilance improvement induced by LT glasses was higher than that produced by LT boxes, <b>suggesting a more prolonged effect of LT glasses which might result from greater blue light enrichment</b>. Future studies with different monochromatic lights will help us to disentangle the different pathways of the non-image forming effects of light.”</li>

<li>"increases in S cone activation lead to a dilation of the pupil [80, 100], which is also controlled by the ipRGCs"</li>
<li>"It has long been thought that cones and rods mediate what is typically considered “vision” (seeing colour, motion, spatial detail), and that melanopsin mediates the “other”, non-visual effects of light, i.e. melatonin suppression, circadian phase shifting, and alertness. However, at second sight, this dichotomy breaks down. There is now converging evidence that melanopsin signals reach the primary visual cortex (V1) [82], where they may contribute to and modulate our visual perception [20, 25, 109]."</li>
<li>"It is important to keep in mind that the retinal photoreceptors experience an altered version of the light relative to the cornea, the front surface of the eye. This is because the eye itself contains filters. In the centre of the retina, this includes the macular pigment, which is present in the fovea but drops off in the peripheral retina. More importantly for ipRGCs, the crystalline lens and ocular media filter out short-wavelength light. This natural “blue-blocking” filter increases density with increasing age, with less and less short-wavelength light reaching the retina."</li>
<li><b>BEST: light both suppress melatonin and shift the circadian rhythm using 2 separate mechanisms! Goes along the way of functional decoupling:</b> "Two effects of light have been interrogated extensively in human circadian and sleep research: (1) the acute suppression of melatonin in response to light exposure and (2) the ability of light exposure to shift circadian phase. <b>However, these two effects are not arising from a unitary pathway resulting in a direct relationship between melatonin suppression and phase shifts. There is now accruing evidence that they may be indeed separable</b> [63]. As a consequence, one should not be used as a proxy for the other [106]."

<li>Why so few studies on circadian rhythm? "Studying light‐induced phase shifting responses of the circadian clock in humans is expensive, time consuming and difficult. It takes days or weeks to examine the light‐induced circadian phase shifting response of a single participant." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a></li>

</li>
<li>"The system mediating melatonin suppression has a spectral sensitivity that is broadly consistent with the spectral sensitivity of melanopsin [17, 60, 88]. Similarly, the spectral sensitivity of circadian phase shifting shows its maximal effect near the peak spectral sensitivity of melanopsin [101]."</li>
<li><b>pulsed light + multiple light sessions</b>: "The human circadian system integrates across multiple light exposures as short as five minutes [48], even intermittent bright light exposure can shift the circadian phase [43, 66]. It has been shown that under certain circumstances, a train of very brief flashes light flashes on the millisecond scale can cause circadian phase shifts which are larger than those caused by continuous light [59, 108]."
<ul>
<li>+ this study that shows that pulsed light can produce more phase shift with less melatonin suppression: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/</a></li>
<li>pulsed intermittent light efficiency is at least known since 2004! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146</a>
<ul>
<li>"As such, other non‐image forming photoreceptive behaviours have been used as proxies for light‐induced circadian phase shifting responses. These include light‐induced melatonin suppression, which is much faster and less expensive to study. Implicit in these studies is that by examining the impact of light on this proxy behaviour, we can induce the manner by which the circadian clock would respond to the same light stimulus. These proxy responses are, as is circadian phase shifting, mediated by the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), formed by axons arising from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) (Hattar et al. 2002). So, the inductive reasoning goes that understanding one output of the RHT (melatonin suppression) will inform us about the output of interest (phase shifting). It must be noted, however, that there is no direct evidence that light‐induced melatonin suppression is mediated by the circadian clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN). As the SCN is necessary for the production of melatonin, it has thus far been impossible to test whether the SCN is also necessary for the light‐induced suppression of melatonin. Indeed, the RHT innervates many loci in the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus, which is part of the pathway leading from the SCN to the pineal, indicating that there is at least anatomical evidence that the physiological pathways leading to different aspects of non‐image forming photoreception may be separable. Furthermore, the RHT does not arise from a uniform set of ipRGCs. Studies in mice have identified <b>at least six different subtypes of ipRGC</b> (Sexton et al. 2012)."</li>
<li>"To address this question, in an article in this issue of The Journal of Physiology, Rahman and colleagues studied 59 participants who were exposed to a variety of light stimuli ranging from continuous dim or bright light to pulses of bright light with interspersed darkness (Rahman et al. 2018). They report that, under these conditions, there is no significant correlation between light‐induced melatonin suppression and light‐induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. In some individuals exposed to long duration (6.5 h) light, robust phase shifts were accompanied by negligible suppression of melatonin (Fig. 2 in Rahman et al.). In some individuals exposed to an hour or less of light, robust suppression of melatonin was accompanied by negligible phase shifts (Fig. 2 in Rahman et al.). The data presented indicate that light induction of melatonin suppression and light induction of circadian phase shifts are separable phenomena. Previous studies using different light stimuli, including red light (Zeitzer et al. 1997) and millisecond flashes of light (Zeitzer et al. 2011), had previously reported on the poor correlation between light‐induced melatonin suppression and light‐induced changes in circadian phase. In these studies, the authors observed an absence of or an inconsistent melatonin suppression in response to light that induced shifts of circadian phase. In all of these studies, it appears that physiologically significant phase shifts can be induced by specific light stimuli in the absence of an accompanying robust decline in melatonin. Thus, while the overall sensitivity to light‐induced melatonin suppression and light‐induced circadian phase shifting is similar, these two non‐image forming functions of light are not necessarily mediated by the same neural pathways and are not necessarily proxies for one another."</li>

<li>Again similar results, with melatonin suppression under a similar timeframe (under 20 min) for both intermittent light therapy and continuous + light therapy increases cortisol levels acutely (but may be due to stress - <b>starting with the eyes closed may fix the issue?

<li>+ "Moreover, short duration stimuli are more effective than long duration stimuli, on a per minute basis (e.g., <b>each minute in a single 12 min stimulus resets the pacemaker 8 times more than per minute of a 4 h stimulus</b>5). Recently, <b>millisecond flashes delivered over one hour has also been shown to induce significant phase shifts</b>68,69."</li>
<li>"Our work shows that the suppressive effects of light exposure on melatonin occur rapidly whereas recovery is a relatively slower process. There are robust and complex changes in cortisol, suggesting an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and modulation of the feedback mechanism in this pathway."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Both melatonin suppression and circadian phase shifts are modulated by the “<b>photic history</b>”, i.e. the amount of light seen during the day [27, 44, 77]. The long-term adaptive influences of the “spectral diet” in the real world remain an important area of investigation [93]."
<ul>
<li>SUMMARY: dark therapy is important because by dimming light (and avoiding the blue colored lights), then the effect of melatonin suppression at wake up is bigger! <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194" title="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194" class="https">https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" class="https">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x</a></li>

</li>
<li>"Specifically, the activity of the circadian pacemaker is aligned to counteract the increasing sleep pressure resulting from sustained wakefulness during daytime. Likewise, the nocturnal increase in circadian sleep tendency counteracts the decrease in sleep propensity resulting from accumulated sleep thereby supporting a consolidated phase of nocturnal sleep."</li>
<li>"Here, shorter daylight exposure and longer nights are associated with a longer biological night as indexed by the duration of melatonin secretion, and thus longer sleep duration [85, 94, 95], which may also reflect a seasonality effect [104]."</li>
<li>"Beyond this, sleep quality is also related to light exposure during the day. Several studies report that daytime exposure to white light enriched in short-wavelength content was associated with increased evening fatigue [91], and sleep quality [16, 39, 91], decreased sleep-onset latency [39], and increased slow-wave sleep accumulation [92], which is related to the dissipation of the homeostatic sleep pressure [1, 14, 34]."</li>
<li>"Also, the effects of evening light exposure do not seem to be independent from exposure during the preceding day. More specifically, Rångtell and colleagues [64] examined the effects of reading a novel on a tablet computer (~102 ± 41 lx, 7718 K) vs. in a physical book (~67 ± 50 lx, 2674 K) for two hours following prolonged (6.5 h) exposure to bright light (~569 lx, 3149 K) between 2:30 pm and 9 pm. Contrasting other findings, the light from the tablet did not suppress melatonin or alter subjective and objective sleep parameters. Note though that also exposure was shorter than in studies that reported significant effects [26, 72, 107]."</li>
<li>me there is a confound, people who have troubles sleeping will be more likely to use screen devices at evening or night.</li>
<li><b>BEST: dark therapy</b>: "Smartphone use may delay sleep onset. One factor is the light emitted by their screens, but another may also be its entertaining character or related psychological effects, or both. Using the “night shift” mode of modern smartphones, the colour balance of the screen can be shifted to “warmer” and orangeish colours depleted in short-wavelength light. On a recent iPhone 7, this amounts to a reduction of melanopsin activation by 67% at full display brightness. This might seem like a large reduction at first, though by simply dimming the smartphone to its minimum level, <b>the melanopsin activation can be reduced to less than 1% of the activation at maximum display brightness</b>."
<ul>
<li>+ combine with: "While initial research suggested that very bright light was required to induce physiologic effects in humans, relatively <b>more recent work shows that half-maximal response of 10,000 lux light is achieved with ~100 lux light including melatonin suppression, circadian phase resetting and the alerting responses</b>3,62." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Recent research using so-called <b>metameric displays</b>, which do not differ in their appearance but only differ in the amount that they stimulate melanopsin, show that the non-visual properties of light can be modulated independently of visual appearance [3, 78]."</li>
<li>"Mood variations have been shown to be influenced by a complex and non-additive interaction between circadian phase and the duration of prior wakefulness. Specifically, relatively moderate changes in the timing of the sleep–wake cycle can significantly modulate mood [11]." "In addition to the circadian effects of light mediated via the SCN, a pathway from the retina to the habenula has recently been found to be involved in mediating effects of light on mood in animal models [38, 110]. This pathway, connecting some ipRGCs with the habenula and bypassing the SCN altogether, has been suggested to specifically mediate light-induced alterations in mood [38]."</li>
<li>"The stabilising effects of light also make BLT a useful additional treatment in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [69], borderline personality disorder [19], and other conditions characterised by sleep–wake disruption, such as schizophrenia [18] or neurodegenerative diseases [103]."</li>
<li>"For CRSWD, the timing of therapeutic light exposure depends on the type of circadian disturbance and the direction of phase shift (advance or delay) to be pursued in order to achieve circadian resynchronisation. Therefore, a reliable marker of circadian phase should be first assessed to identify the phase position and then determine the timing of light treatment. The gold standard for measuring circadian phase is obtained by quantifying the so-called dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), i.e. the time at which melatonin levels rise above baseline, indicating that melatonin secretion has started. However, implementing DLMO assessment in the clinical practice remains difficult due to the limited availability of equipped centres that perform melatonin analyses and the costs of this diagnostic procedure, which are currently not reimbursed by health insurances in most European countries."</li>
<li>"BLT is particularly effective when exposure to light occurs regularly, i.e. on a daily basis, for at least 30–60 min."</li>
<li>"Disease relapses due to lacking therapeutic adherence depend on the underlying pathological condition: while SAD may rapidly reappear after a short therapy break, isolated days without light therapy are unlikely to have any negative consequences on circadian rhythm stabilisation in CRSWD, if regular sleep-wake schedules are maintained."</li>
<li><b>"Ideally designed devices illuminate the patient diagonally from above with an irradiation angle of ~ 15°</b>.

<li>"Retinal illuminance may also be modulated by squinting and the specific facial features,such asthe brow, nose, and eyelid position, of an individual [37]. Finally, the retinal image is displaced frequently by head, eye and trunk movements [38–40]."</li>
<li>"Human exposure to light has changed profoundly. In the US in the 1800s, it is estimated that 90% of the population worked outside. By 2001, Americans spent 87% of their wake hours indoors [41]. The consequences of this substantial shift are poorly appreciated and the consequences on human health and performance remain unclear."</li>
<li>"This ‘nesting’ of different neurophysiological processes and their entangled outcomes illustrates the complexity of separating indirect effects from direct effects. For this reason, it is a key challenge to develop methods of assessing the stability of the circadian system under different illumination patterns over extended periods of time (i.e. days and weeks)."</li>
<li>"Drawing an analogy to food, we refer to these patterns of light exposure as the ‘spectral diet’. The absolute spectral diet is the pattern of absolute spectral irradiance a human observer might receive over the course of a specific amount of time. The relative spectral diet refers to the spectral composition, or spectral quality, of the light received. Both absolute and relative spectral diets are important. The analogy to food diet here is the following: one might eat, over the course of the waking day, a fixed number of calories, for example, 2000 kcal. This number itself does not tell us how these 2000 kcal were spread across the different macronutrients. Similarly, an illuminance of 2000 lx received during daytime hours does not tell us how the different photoreceptors were affected by it."</li>
<li>"The spectral diet is not simply a characterisation of the spectral environment for its own sake but could potentially also lead to inferences about the properties that an ‘ideal’ – or statistically optimal – observer’s photoreceptive system should have (e.g. spectral tuning, or temporal filtering properties)."</li>
<li>See Fig 2</li>
<li>"A recent international standard (CIE S 026/E:2018) describes a retinally referenced framework for quantifying the effects of light from a given radiance or irradiance spectrum [53]. This standard, based on previous proposals[54], allowsfor the determination of the extent to which the L, M and S cones, the rods, and melanopsin are activated by a given spectrum. "</li>
<li>+ combine with: "Similar to invertebrate opsins, <b>melanopsin photopigment</b> is thought to function as <b>both a photoreceptor and photoisomerase</b> (33–35). That is, after activation of melanopsin by light, a different portion of the light spectrum regenerates the chromophore and restores melanopsin photosensitivity. Whereas melanopsin phototransduction is most sensitive to short-wavelength light, recent studies suggest that melanopsin photoisomerase activity may be more sensitive to longer-wavelength light (26,36,37). <b>We found, however, that exposure to 460 nm alone could maintain melatonin suppression for at least 6.5 h, despite the absence of exposure to any other wavelengths of light that could potentially interconvert ‘meta’-melanopsin back to its photosensitive form. Short-wavelength light may therefore be sufficient to elicit melanopsin photoisomerase activity, even if long-wavelength light is more efficient at restoring photoreceptor function.</b>" <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/</a></li>

<li>" These results are in agreement with previous reports showing sustained melatonin suppression in response to polychromatic white light exposure for up to 12 h3,48."</li>
<li><b>BEST: light therapy inhibits melatonin faster than natural endogenous synthesis cessation</b>: "Interestingly, the rate of melatonin suppression was significantly faster under both intermittent (t1/2 of ~13 min) and continuous (t1/2 of ~18 min) light exposure as compared to the rate of decrease in melatonin levels following the cessation of melatonin synthesis estimated as SynOff (t1/2 of ~56 min)45.

<li><b>BEST: variation of color matters!

<li>ME: Keep in mind mice are nocturnal, so they prefer to live during the yellow period, whereas humans (and guina pigs) are diurnal so the effect is the opposite (blue light preference).</li>
<li>Fig1 &amp; 2: Both blue AND yellow can impact the rhythm! The more saturated the color, the more shift is observed. If no cycle in color during the day, the mice are freerunning, with a longer tau period and smaller sleep duration with more saturation!</li>
<li>BEST: Fig1.I suggests that once the mice were freerunning due to continuous monochromatic color exposure, they stayed in a non24 freerunning cycle!</li>
<li>"In summary, these data provide some support for the idea that color may aid entrainment to low-amplitude light dark cycles but suggest that, for robust entrainment, changes in light intensity greater than those achievable here are required."</li>
<li>"Instead, <b>a more globally relevant potential benefit of using color is to compensate for stochastic fluctuations in the diurnal rhythm of light intensity</b>, e.g., due to <b>variations in cloud cover</b> [11, 12]."</li>
<li>"Clouds can reduce ambient light levels by &gt;10-fold, rendering the timing of sunrise/sunset ambiguous for a system that relies simply on light intensity. The twilight blue shift, however, is retained irrespective of clouds [9, 10, 11]."</li>
<li>Confirmed: "Importantly, however, when we analyzed the day-day similarity of activity patterns (by calculating the mean pairwise correlations), we found a significant reduction under intensity-only days (Figure 4H), indicating that <b>daily activity timing was more variable in the absence of color signals</b>."</li>
<li>"<b>In summary, naturalistic diurnal variations in color confer enhanced robustness and stability to daily activity patterns in the face of weather-related fluctuations in light intensity.</b>"</li>
<li>"Specifically, interdaily stability was significantly reduced following intensity-only versus natural days (Figure 4E), and this effect was associated with <b>significant increases in the percentage of daily activity occurring outside the projected night</b> (Figure 4F), increased intradaily variability (Figure 4G), and a reduction in mean day-day correlation (Figure 4H). These data thereby confirm that naturalistic variations in color substantially enhance the amplitude and stability of clock-driven behavioral rhythms when the diurnal variation in light intensity provides unreliable timing information." → just like non24 having their brains staying active for too long!</li>
<li>"Indeed, direct investigations of human circadian resetting reveal that low-intensity, short-wavelength light (460 nm) produces smaller responses than longer wavelength light (555 nm) of equivalent melanopic illuminance [3]."</li>
<li>"A strong prediction of our research is that these changes in color may oppose any benefits obtained from modulating melanopsin photon capture. Recent work indicates that melanopsin-directed modulations that lack perceptible difference in color exert beneficial effects [45, 46]. Our data now suggest that supplementing such approaches with color changes of the appropriate direction could be especially effective at modulating circadian responses."</li>

<li>"In most subjects, exposure to 460 nm light elicited a relatively constant amount of melatonin suppression during the light exposure, whereas exposure to 555 nm light elicited an initially strong suppression of melatonin which gradually recovered to baseline values even in the continued presence of light (Fig. 1C) (12). [...] <b>indicating that short-wavelength light was much more effective than longer-wavelength light at suppressing melatonin</b> in the latter half of the 6.5-h light exposure." Fig1 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/</a></li>
<li>"On the basis of this short-wavelength shift in spectral sensitivity, we hypothesize that cone photoreceptors provide for temporary suppression of the melatonin rhythm, whereas melanopsin signals light information continuously across long-duration exposure to light. Consistent with this interpretation, a blind individual with no detectable rod or cone function showed a constant level of melatonin suppression across a 6.5-h exposure to 460 nm light, whereas 555 nm light did not suppress melatonin at all (4)."</li>
<li>"In an article published while this study was in progress, the spectral sensitivity of human melanopsin cells was defined by examining sustained pupillary constriction after the offset of a light stimulus (25). <b>The fitted peak in spectral sensitivity was 482 nm</b>, which is consistent with the spectral tuning of melanopsin cells in the macaque and in lower mammals (8,20). Therefore, the 460 nm light stimulus that was used in the present study likely elicited strong, but sub-maximal, stimulation of the melanopsin cells. Similarly, although 555 nm light is best at stimulating the photopic visual system, which is dominated by middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones, short-wavelength-sensitive cones respond maximally to ~420 nm light and provide input to the melanopsin cells (20). Hence, the short-wavelength stimulus that we used does not provide for complete isolation of the melanopsin-driven response, and we cannot rule out the possibility that rod photoreceptors contributed to the responses."</li>
<li>"Based on the short-wavelength sensitivity of melanopsin, it has been hypothesized that phototherapy can be optimized by using predominantly short-wavelength blue light. Our results indicate that <b>short-duration (&lt;90 min) retinal exposure to narrow-bandwidth 555 nm light (≤24 lux) may be as effective, if not more effective, than an equivalent photon dose of 460 nm light (≤2 lux)</b>." → but ONLY if short-duration, because if session is too long, melatonin is progressively restored! And even if the light is still on!</li>
<li>SUMMARY: blue light is better at suppressing melatonin, but since melatonin suppression is not necessarily related to circadian rhythm shift, actimetry is way better to test activity and estimate the circadian rhythm. Both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a> show that light can have an effect even without melatonin suppression, hence yellow light therapy may be as effective as blue light therapy, without melatonin suppression?</li>

<li>"Further analysis of these 15 reports indicated that a two-hour exposure to blue light (460 nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin, the <b>maximum melatonin-suppressing effect being achieved at the shortest wavelengths (424 nm, violet)</b>. The <b>melatonin concentration recovered rather rapidly, within 15 min from cessation of the exposure, suggesting a short-term</b> or simultaneous impact of light exposure on the melatonin secretion. Melatonin secretion and suppression were reduced with age, but the <b>light-induced circadian phase advance was not impaired with age</b>." — &gt; BEST: so light does NOT stop melatonin production, it only inhibits as long as light exposure is maintained, and then it goes back up! This can also be seen clearly in Fig1.C of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/</a></li>
<li>"In addition, even the longest wavelengths (631 nm, red) and intermittent light exposures induced circadian resetting responses, and exposure to low light levels (5–10 lux) at night when sleeping with eyes closed induced a circadian response."</li>
<li>"Exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) has been estimated to increase annually by 3–6% in past decades (Hölker et al. 2010) and continues to extend further in space, time, and intensity with more than 2% annual growth in radiance and extent (Kyba et al. 2017)."</li>
<li>"In addition to melatonin secretion, light exposure affects sleep-wakefulness cycle. Thus, as rapid-eyemovement (REM) sleep timing is controlled by the master circadian clock (Lee et al. 2009), the circadian rhythm disruption can also be detected by measuring REM sleep parameters with electroencephalogram (EEG)."</li>
<li>BEST: light impacts the circadian rhythm way more than sleep hygiene/having a fixed sleep schedule: " Subjects kept their normal schedule for the first 5 days and received morning and evening light exposures the following 7 days in addition to a fixed sleep schedule (advanced by 90 min from the baseline). <b>The study showed that the direction of circadian phase change is determined by the light-dark exposure, not by the fixed sleep schedule, and that both morning and evening light exposures need to be controlled to shift circadian phase.</b> After 7 days on the fixed 90-min advanced sleep schedule, circadian phase advanced by 132 ± 19 min in advance group and delayed by 59 ± 7.5 min in delay group."</li>
<li>No difference in the response to light exposure between chronotypes: "No significant difference was found in the responses to light exposure between the two types of chronotypes. DLMO was significantly delayed after the delaying light exposure and significantly advanced after the advancing light exposure in both groups compared to the baseline week. The light-induced circadian phase changes were consistent with those predicted by previously published PRCs for both chronotypes. It was noted that light exposures of the subjects during the baseline weeks were significantly less than those during the weeks of light exposure."</li>
<li>BEST TOSEE: "<b>To a surprise, after wake-up in the morning, exposure to blue light (Crowley and Carskadon 2010; Sharkey et al. 2011) or blue-enriched light (Sander et al. 2015) for one hour was not effective in shifting the phase the circadian rhythm of melatonin. However, exposure to blue light, if administered with a sleep-advancing scheme (</b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="Geerdink et al. 2016" class="https">Geerdink et al. 2016</a><b>) or with a control of conflicting light exposure (Appleman et al. 2013; Figueiro et al. 2014), produced a phase shift of the circadian rhythm of melatonin as anticipated.</b>"</li>
<li>"This shifted the timing of the circadian clock without major alterations to sleep itself. Similarly, Figueiro and Rea (2012) showed <b>how light delivered through eyelids during one hour suppressed melatonin and phase shift DLMO. Both studies suggested that phototherapy may also be given with closed eyes, and even while asleep</b> (Zeitzer et al. 2014)."</li>
<li>"As for the individual sensitivity to evening light exposures, Canton et al. (2009) did not find differences between blue and brown iris colour in the magnitude of the effect, but Higuchi et al. (2008) showed that inter-individual difference in pupil area positively correlates with melatonin suppression. Also, in the early pubertal and prepubertal phase, adolescents were significantly more sensitive to evening light that in the late pubertal or postpubertal phase, even at a low, 150 lux exposure level (Crowley et al. 2015)."</li>
<li>"For example, experimentally induced phase shifts of about one and a half hour had only a minimal effect on subsequent sleep propensity and architecture in healthy individuals (Carrier and Dumont 1995)."</li>
<li>"Noteworthy, individual melatonin levels were also found to respond very differently to light, as some individuals had suppressed melatonin at a typical room light conditions, whereas some individuals did not react to a moderate light exposure (Santhi et al. 2012)."</li>
<li>dark therapy is necessary: "To avoid unwanted changes in the circadian phase or night-time sleep, light exposure in the evening and at night as well as in the morning needs to be controlled, as even the longest wavelengths (631 nm) or intermittent light exposures do induce circadian resetting responses."</li>
<li><b>BEST: confirmation that eyes closed is OK to start the light therapy</b>: "<b>The eyelid acts as a red-pass filter</b> (Zeitzer et al. 2014) <b>and transmits only approximately 3%–14% of light</b> (Robinson et al. 1991) in a wavelength-dependent manner. Thus, the retinal exposure of light depends on the status of the eyes (open, closed)."</li>
<li>"Use of oral contraceptives has been found to increase night-time melatonin levels and the menstrual phase may affect the melatonin level (Webley and Leidenberger 1986; Wright and Badia 1999)."</li>
<li>"In addition to potential increased cancer risk, <b>lower melatonin secretion is associated with a higher risk for type 2 diabetes (McMullan et al. 2013)</b>."</li>

<li>"<b>The scheme was based on the habitual sleep offset of days 4 to 10 in the baseline period and consisted of 1 h advance every 3 days.</b> This scheme was followed by 7 posttreatment days without sleeping instructions and no use of light treatment devices (see Figure 1)."</li>
<li>blue-blocker glasses UVEX used in a study: "they were asked to wear blue light–blocking glasses (Uvex S1933X; Skyper Safety Eyewear)"</li>
<li>"Subjects wore glasses or a hairband with a light sensor, Daysimeter (Lumen Tech Innovations, New York, NY), which measured spectral characteristics of light at the eye level. The Daysimeter employs 2 photosensors that separately measure a photopic (visual) and a short-wavelength (blue) response to optical radiation."</li>
<li>"Light was administered on average 10.4 h, 9.4 h, and 8.4 h (±1.2 h) after baseline DLMO on, respectively, the first days (days 15-17), middle days (days 18-20), and last days (days 21-23) of the treatment period (which is close to the optimal timing for phase advances, see the opening section of the article)."</li>
<li>"All light measurements were monitored with the Daysimeter light sensor (see the “Compliance” section for more information). This was done since not only morning light is of influence on our circadian system; it is the complete pattern of light exposure during the whole day that is responsible for phase-shifting effects (Appleman et  al., 2013; Burgess, 2013b). Especially low light levels in the evening are essential for an optimal phase advance."</li>
<li>Fig 2.B : after stopping treatment, the phase delays on its own, but more slowly after blue light therapy.</li>
<li>Blue light maintains sleep integrity/efficiency better during phase advancing treatment than using another light: "These results may indicate that participants in the amber group had less consolidated sleep during the treatment period compared with subjects in the blue light group"</li>
<li>"Light has dual effects on the output of melatonin. It regulates the phase of melatonin by resetting the SCN (Khalsa et al., 2003; Rüger et  al., 2006), and light suppresses melatonin concentrations when it is produced (Lewy et  al., 1980; Zeitzer et al., 2000), probably via inhibition of the activity of the B-adrenergic receptors (Cagnacci et  al., 1992). Therefore, the melatonin production could have been increased by 2 processes: either by an increase in the synchronization of single-cell firings in the SCN (Meijer et al., 1998, Masubuchi et al., 1999; Harb et al., 2014), and therefore in the amplitude of the underlying circadian oscillation, or by a increase in the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light signals, which may result in an upregulation of the B-adrenergic receptors."</li>
<li><b>Need to first wait to be in phase, to optimize photic history</b>: "It has been found that sleep schedules alone can phase advance the melatonin rhythm (Gordijn et  al., 1999; Danilenko et  al., 2003; Sharkey et al., 2011). In a home setting, earlier sleep and wake times will also automatically result in an earlier light exposure pattern, which in turn will induce a phase advance. Yet, despite all the environmental influences of a home setting in the current study, additional blue light on top of the phaseadvancing sleep protocol turned out to be more effective in advancing DLMO than additional amber light. This can be explained only by the significant difference in the amount of short blue wavelengths in the morning in the blue light protocol (2306 melanopic lux from the device and 1485 blue lux measured by the Daysimeter between 0600 h and 1200 h) compared with the amber light protocol (70 melanopic lux from the device and 965 blue lux measured by the Daysimeter between 0600 h and 1200 h), since exposure to all other white light and blue light intensities during the day were not significantly different between the 2 groups."</li>
<li><b>Blue light increases melatonin production at the same time it phase advances it!</b> "In the blue light condition, the total area under the curve of the nighttime melatonin pattern was larger after treatment compared with baseline, while this was not the case in the amber light condition."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: DLMO goes back to the baseline time after treatment, so need to maintain treatment to stabilize DLMO in place</b>: "Despite the fact that the DLMO returned to baseline values at the last day of the protocol posttreatment, participants in the blue light therapy group still woke up about 30 min earlier compared with participants in the amber light group during the posttreatment period."</li>
<li>"Low daytime light levels are correlated with poor sleep quality scores (Leger et al., 2011; Boubekri et al., 2014), whereas increased light levels during the day are correlated with an improvement of sleep quality (Viola et al., 2008; Paul et al., 2015). It should be noted that most of these studies included only subjective sleep quality scores and that studies were either only correlational or, in case of an experimental setup, light intensity during the day was increased without paying attention to its timing."</li>
<li><b>BEST: Blue light therapy decreases the number of naps, increases sleep quality and avoids lengthening of sleep duration likely due to increased sleep fragmentation due to the phase advance chronotherapy</b>: "During treatment, WASO and the number of sleep bouts were significantly increased and sleep efficiency was significantly decreased for participants in the amber group compared with baseline whereas they were not different in participants of the blue group. At the same time, sleep duration was increased in the amber group and not in the blue group. We speculate that <b>the longer sleep duration in the amber group is a consequence of the increased sleep fragmentation and that the increased sleep fragmentation resulted from the induced mismatch between sleep timing and melatonin secretion</b>: both groups were given the instructions to sleep 2 h earlier by the end of the treatment period, while the DLMO of the blue and amber group shifted for 84 and 48 min, respectively. In a study by Lazar and colleagues (2013), it was found that if the phase angle between the DLMO and habitual sleep onset is shorter, people have a higher insomnia score. In the present study, higher concentrations of melatonin were reached later in the amber group compared with the blue group, and the phase angle between DLMO and sleep was shorter."</li>
<li><b>Blue light increases vigilance, and with strongest effect directly at wake-up (when sleep inertia is the highest)</b>: "Blue light was more efficient in decreasing sleep inertia after waking up than amber light was. It is known that blue-enriched light is efficient in keeping humans alert (Hommes &amp; Giménez, 2015), especially during the night when sleepiness scores are high (Lockley et al., 2006; Rüger et al., 2006; Phipps-Nelson et al., 2009; Chellappa et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2014). Because the effect is strongest at high sleepiness scores, one would expect that the effectiveness of blue light during the day would be highest directly after waking up. The results of the present study are indeed in line with this theory. They are also consistent with an earlier study of Revell and colleagues (2006), wherein they used light of different wavelengths and found that the alerting effect of light with 470 nm (blue light) is strongest directly after waking up."</li>
<li><b>BUT blue light therapy doesn't help with performance, it's still suboptimal at wake-up because of mismatch with melatonin which reverts back to its previous state over time after treatment</b>: "Performance was significantly worse in the morning in the posttreatment period, also for the blue light group. This may be explained by the changed phase angle between the melatonin rhythm and sleep phase after light therapy. The participants in the blue group still woke up earlier compared with baseline, while the timing of their melatonin rhythm was shifted back to the timing during the baseline period. This especially may have had consequences for performance in the morning, as the participants woke up too early in relation to their internal clock."</li>
<li><b>BEST: postprandial sleepiness = postprandial dip, and it's dependent on duration of prior awake period and circadian clock</b>: "The postlunch dip is dependent on an interaction between the duration of prior waking and the circadian clock (Bes et al., 2009)."</li>
<li>"<b>After treatment, the phase advance of the melatonin rhythm shifted back to the original values</b>, while sleep timing was still advanced after the use of blue light therapy. This confirms that blue light therapy was supportive in shifting the sleep phase more than amber light was. <b>Whether the discrepancy between the melatonin rhythm and sleep phase after light therapy is desirable is the question, as performance was worse during the morning after treatment in the blue light therapy group</b>. To investigate if performance can be stabilized and if the effects on sleep are long-lasting, more research should be done on longer (blue) light therapy protocols with voluntary sleep timing."</li>

<li>Safety:
<ul>
<li>Light therapy: is it safe for the eyes? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192</a>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Results suggest that light therapy is safe for the eyes in physically healthy, unmedicated persons.</b> The ocular safety of light therapy in persons with preexisting ocular abnormalities or increased photosensitivity warrants further study. However, theoretical considerations do not substantiate stringent ocular safety-related contraindications for light therapy."</li>
<li>"Previous research has shown that the blue range of visible light, particularly between 450 and 500 nm, has the strongest effect on the biological clock (19–24), as the photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells primarily involved in circadian regulation express melanopsin, a blue light-sensitive photopigment with a peak absorption of about 480 nm (25, 26)."</li>
<li>"Initially, light therapy was performed with light boxes that emitted skylight-like light. Later, ordinary white fluorescent light-emitting boxes were used, as research showed that <b>ultraviolet (UV) light was not required for antidepressant effects</b> (27)."</li>
<li>"To prevent side effects from looking into a light source (e.g., glare), persons are often advised to place a light source in a 45-degree angle with respect to the eyes and to avoid staring in the light, which leads to exposure of the peripheral retina as well."</li>
<li>ME: Ah I remember: the light in the Luminette is anyway way less than the sun, so no problem. And other white light lamps have blue light too.</li>
<li>"A study that compared two conditions that provided similar amounts of biologically effective radiation and therefore probably quite similar blue light hazards showed that the monochromatic blue low lux light condition produced more ocular complaints compared to the white high lux light condition (28). This may suggest that the monochromaticity of the light or light color may play a more important role in the occurrence of ocular complaints than the biologically effective irradiance and illuminance."</li>
<li>"A large epidemiological study found a higher level of exposure to blue light in persons with advanced AMD as compared to age-matched controls (73), and shorter wavelength visible radiation has been suggested to accelerate retinal aging (74, 75). The progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may therefore be stimulated by light therapy. It can be questioned, however, whether light therapy significantly contributes to the blue light hazard already provided by the environment, as the levels used for light therapy fall well below the amount encountered on a sunny day outdoors (120 000 lux). Nonetheless, prolonged light therapy may provide a greater cumulative blue light hazard than is normally experienced by some people (37): Modern indoor lighting provides only 5% of natural light intensities (76, 77) and longer wavelength spectra (78), and exposure to natural light is strongly dependent on behavioural factors (79, 80). There is no evidence supporting the development or progression of retinal vascular disease, such as diabetic retinopathy, with increased light exposure (81). The etiology of these conditions differs from that of AMD and is primarily vascular, although a neurodegenerative component may play a role in diabetic retinopathy as well (82)."</li>

<li><b>IMPORTANT CRITICAL ME</b>: we assume that sleep time and wake up time are linked, they are one same process, but that may not be the case: it may very well be that triggering the endogenous melatonin production by exogenous melatonin pills intake may not change the time at which it stops. Hence, melatonin suppression at wake-up may be necessary, and complementary with melatonin, in order to gain full control of the endogenous melatonin production cycle, and hence some degree of control over the circadian rhythm. PREVIOUS NOTE: CRITICAL ME: My own sleep data<b> suggests that the wake up time is managed by an independent process, different from the fatigue process which governs bedtime, contrary to what we usually believe. So need to treat them separately.</b> In other words, getting to bed and even to sleep earlier does not make one wake up earlier, and waking up earlier does not make one sleeping earlier. Although of course both help each other and so are linked in some way (at least in terms of wakeful state duration which builds up adenosine and hence fatigue, but this can be counterbalanced by dopamine with sleep deprivation buildup), but the link between these processes is weaker than usually thought, they are not causative but correlative. One can be fixed without the other being fixed. Ideally, both should be fixed, but they are fixed using different methods since they are different processes.
<ul>
<li><b>CONFIRMED: melatonin suppression is decoupled (although correlated) with circadian phase shifting: we can phase shift without having a significant melatonin suppression, and inversely. There are other pathways than melatonin that light can stimulate, hence why light therapy is necessary:</b> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" class="https">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x</a></li>
<li><b>2ND CONFIRMATION: Functional Decoupling of Melatonin Suppression and Circadian Phase Resetting in Humans, 2019, Czeisler et al</b> <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/</a> : "These results suggest that <b>phase shifts and melatonin suppression are functionally independent such that one cannot be used as a proxy measure of the other</b>." → light is NOT enough for entrainment!
<ul>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: also confirms that longer light exposure / photic history, intermittent or not (6.5h), produces way more phase shift than a smaller duration, whether or not there is more melatonin suppression.</b> Actually, intermittent bright light (IBL) for 6.5h produces almost as much phase shift as continuous, but virtually without melatonin suppression:
<ul>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image010.png"></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ME: this shows that light therapy devices are triggering other circadian resetting mechanisms apart from melatonin suppression (although there is a correlation between light exposure and melatonin suppression, but it's not the only way light can affect the circadian rhythm). That is a big discovery because it shows that melatonin is NOT doing everything about the circadian rhythm (so melatonin is NOT a 1-to-1 proxy for the circadian rhythm), and it's shedding some light as why melatonin intake is complementary to light exposure in the morning (and avoidance of light in the evening). Melatonin is not the circadian rhythm, but we don't have the technology to directly study the circadian rhythm, so researchers use melatonin profiles. But we need to see beyond, as this can explain observations of CRSWD people who can sleep at a variable time but wake up at the same time, or when they sleep earlier and longer but still end up waking up later and later as with the non-24 syndrome.</li>

<li>"circadian-clock disruption can promote alcohol consumption, which can further exacerbate this cycle. For example, Per2 mutant mice exhibit increased alcohol consumption compared with wild-type counterparts (Spanagel et al. 2005)"</li>
<li>"This may explain why humans with circadian disruption are more prone to substance abuse disorders (Trinkoff and Storr 1998)."</li>
<li>circadian disruption reduces the immune system: "In addition to genetically manipulating circadian homeostasis, environmentally disrupting circadian rhythms also negatively affects immune function. For example, loss of regular sleep/wake cycles alters the normal circadian rhythmicity observed in immune cells (Bryant et al. 2004; Vgontzas et al. 2004) and increases the susceptibility to infections (Everson 1993; Mohren et al. 2002). Indeed, chronically shifting light/dark cycles in mice augments LPS-induced immune response, resulting in greater mortality compared with non–circadian-disrupted mice (Castanon-Cervantes et al. 2010)."</li>
<li>"Eating is an environmental factor that selectively affects peripheral circadian rhythmicity in the intestine and liver. Feeding at the incorrect time (e.g., late-night eating for humans) can result in internal circadian misalignment. For example, restricted feeding paradigms in which animals only have access to food during inappropriate times (i.e., during the light cycle for nocturnal rodents) results in misalignment between central light-entrained circadian rhythms (i.e., in the SCN) and peripheral food-entrained circadian rhythms, including those in the liver (Damiola et al. 2000). Recent studies suggest that this internal misalignment scenario is linked to weight gain, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Indeed, mice fed during the inappropriate time gain more weight (Arble et al. 2009; Salgado-Delgado et al. 2010) than mice fed during appropriate time, despite similar activity levels and caloric intake (Arble et al. 2009). This phenomenon also is observed in humans; people who skip breakfast and have eating patterns shifted toward late-night eating tend to be more overweight than those who consume food during more appropriate time periods (Berkey et al. 2003; Ma et al. 2003).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Genetic abnormalities in the molecular circadian clock also are associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes (Scott et al. 2008; Woon et al. 2007). For example, Clock mutant mice, which have disrupted circadian rhythms (Vitaterna et al. 1994), are obese and demonstrate characteristics of metabolic syndrome such as high cholesterol levels and high blood glucose (Turek et al. 2005). Bmal1 mutant mice also have disrupted circadian rhythmicity (Bunger et al. 2000), disrupted adipogenesis (Shimba et al. 2005), and demonstrate markers of metabolic syndrome (e.g., higher levels of triglycerides and glucose) (Marcheva et al. 2010; Rudic et al. 2004). Similarly, mutations in Cry genes disrupt hormonal rhythms (Fu et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2009) and Cry mutants show markers of metabolic syndrome (Okano et al. 2009).

<li>44% to 83% of children and adolescents with ASD have sleep issues.</li>
<li>"Children and 13 adolescents with intellectual disabilities and severe symptoms associated with ASD are at especially high risk for sleep problems.5-7 14 Sleep disturbances are associated with communication deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors in ASD. 8, 9 15 Sleep disorders negatively affect sleep and quality of life of affected individuals and their families. 10 16 Disordered sleep is also associated with daytime behavioral disturbances, 11-13 increased injury risk, 14, 15 obesity, 16 17 and poor academic performance17-19 18 in general pediatric populations."</li>
<li>"<b>Contributors to circadian rhythm misalignment potentially include dysregulated melatonin synthesis or altered melatonin secretion patterns, circadian clock gene anomalies</b>, 20 21 and 22 decreased awareness of social and environmental clues that help habituate sleep–wake cycles. 23 Abnormalities in GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic systems in ASD 16 1 are also possible contributors. Coexisting conditions such as epilepsy, nocturnal 2 gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and 3 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can further contribute to sleep problems. Core 4 or co-occurring ASD symptoms such as intellectual disability, sensory integration deficits, 5 ritualistic or self-injurious behaviors, poor communication skills, and limited responsiveness to 6 social cues can interfere with sleep training and exacerbate or prolong sleep problems."</li>

<li>"The magnitude of circadian regulation of metabolism is underscored by recent appreciation that <b>metabolism is an integral component in the mammalian circadian network</b>.55,63 More specifically, the molecular timekeeping mechanism within individual cells, known as the circadian clock, directly modulates multiple metabolic processes in a time-of-day-dependent manner, whereas fluctuations in metabolism act in a feedback manner, thereby modulating the clock mechanism (through changes in energy charge, ROS, redox status, acetylation, O-GlcNAcylation, etc).55,63 An added layer of complexity stems from appreciation that the responsiveness of the heart to a variety of factors known to modulate metabolism is similarly subject to circadian regulation (eg, insulin responsiveness).64,65 In many ways, metabolism can be considered a “moving target.”"</li>

<li>Plus combined with the fact that melatonin should not be used for insomnia according to AASM: <a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470" title="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470" class="https">https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6470</a> - but AASM suggests it's a potential treatment for CRSWD in their 2015 guidelines: <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" class="https">https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf</a></li>

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL NEW TREATMENT</b>: which resets molecular clocks, in the cells! It does a total phase reversal (ie, 12h phase delay). This is the only treatment we have to reset the circadian rhythm at the cellular/molecular level! A new study suggests that a synthetic form of cordycepin, a compound found in a cheap medicinal fungus C.militaris, can reset the circadian clock at the cellular level for up to 12 hours. "new study suggests that a <b>synthetic form of cordycepin</b>, a compound found in a medicinal fungus", "Cordycepin is the active ingredient in a fungus called <b>C. militaris</b>", "The difference is that C. militaris is much cheaper, and in turn, much easier to get.", "<b>In mice</b>, scientists found that synthetic cordycepin drastically helped the animals adjust to time change. Normally when mice are exposed to an 8 hour time change — imagine flying from New York to Abu Dhabi — <b>it would take them 10 days to adjust. The mice on cordycepin took only four days</b>.", "We want to let people know that drastic and quick changes for our body clock are possible," Zhang says." <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" class="https">https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769</a> and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound</a>
<ul>
<li>Works equally well for phase delay and phase advance: "When they dosed mice with either 15mg/kg or 45 mg/kg of the synthetic cordycepin, <b>the mice were able to more easily able to adjust when they were forced to live in a "time zone" 8 hours earlier</b> than what they were used to, as compared to mice who did not receive the compound. <b>That same pattern held when the mice were put in a time zone 8 hours behind their own</b> (imagine flying from New York to Baker Island, an uninhabited island about halfway between Hawaii and Australia). "In both cases, <b>our drug administration shortened the adaptation time to at least one half</b>," says Zhang."</li>
<li>How it works? "The team found the synthetic cordycepin can bind to an enzyme called <b>RUVBL2</b>, and influence transcription of clock genes. These are genes when are turned "on" and "off" as the body goes through our 24-hour cycles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
RUVBL2, importantly, was abundant in areas of the mouse brain like the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This is the light-sensitive area of the brain that is the master controller of our circadian rhythm.<br>
Cordycepin binds to RUVBL2, which creates a cascade of changes. First, a crucial protein is forced to leave chromatin, a structure that condenses DNA into packages (like a .zip does for images). Once that protein leaves, other genes related to the circadian rhythm, called E-box genes, are transcribed freely.<br>
Cordycepin can be thought of as a key that "unlocks" the ability to transcribe those genes. Once that happens, a new oscillation (or a cycle of 24 hours) begins. The clock is reset.<br>
Overall, Zhang theorizes that this <b>"magic drug can change the clock phase up to 12 hours."</b><br>
"A timed regulation of our internal body clock is possible.""

<li>Can it be useful for non24 and DSPD? Of course! But only if it works and is safe for humans consumption.

<li>"Our experiments also showed that <b>cordycepin has a short half-life, as the cordycepin concentration in the cells was very low 4 hours after administration</b> (Fig. 1E). The phase-shifting effect of cordycepin was <b>dependent on the time of administration</b>: The shape of the phase response curve following cordycepin administration showed <b>a strong phase-shift (&gt;6 hours)</b> phenotype, which is categorized as the <b>“type 0–resetting,”</b> where there is a discontinuity existing at the transition between phase advance and delay (Fig. 1F and data file S1) (23)."</li>

<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Two definitions: either type 0 is considered absolute (no time-dependent effect depending on when it's taken in relation to the circadian rhythm) or it's more potent phase shift effect than type 1 (eg, type 1 is &lt; 6h delay, which can be due to environmental factors such as temperature or sample damaging, whereas type 0 &gt; 6h shift).</li>
<li>"Another possibility to synchronise circadian rhythms with their cyclic environment is if every zeitgeber stimulus – no matter when it is received – resets the rhythm to the same internal phase (e.g., to the beginning of the internal day). This type of resetting is called type 0." → cordycepin is a type 0 resetter, but theoretically any zeitgeber can become a type 0 resetter if intensity is sufficient</li>
<li>"Stable entrainment is achieved when a zeitgeber stimulus can shift the phase of the circadian rhythms each day by the exact amount that compensates the difference between the free-running period and that of the zeitgeber (normally 24 h)."</li>
<li>BEST: mentions "An Atlas of Phase Responses Curves for Circadian and Circatidal Rhythms" <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" title="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" class="https">https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/</a></li>
<li>Hence here for cordycepin, the definition of type 0 used is not of absolute resetter irrespective of administration time, but rather the latter definition that if the dosage is high enough, the resetting will be &gt;6h (a "phase reversal").</li>
<li><b>BEST ME: cordycepin is an adenosine analog, so it has more to do with the homeostatic process S, and yet it also controls the circadian rhythm C. Hence both processes are likely interdependent.</b></li>
<li>"RuvB-like ATPase 2 (<b>RUVBL2</b>) interacts with other known clock proteins on chromatin to regulate the circadian phase"</li>
<li>"Clock malfunctions result in sleep disorders and lead to other diseases (1–4), and <b>a recent study emphasized that circadian timing must be considered when clinicians select the dosage regime for a given medicine</b> (5). The eukaryotic clock consists of a core oscillator that regulates its own transcriptional activity via negative feedback, generating a roughly 24-hour rhythm in cells, tissues, and whole organisms (6). There are multiple associated transcriptional feedback loops that engage with the core oscillator to form a nested network that hierarchically regulates physiological rhythms throughout the organism (7, 8)"</li>
<li>"even fewer studies have examined the phase of the clock, which is very sensitive to environmental perturbations (10, 13). Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the phase may actually be equally, if not more, important for the clock than either the period or amplitude, as the phase of entrainment defines the regulatory control points for circadian transcription and determines the time at which the clock oscillation begins (14)."</li>
<li>BEST PROTOCOL of administration of cordycepin: 15mg/kg one day just before <b>current</b> wake up time, whether to phase advance or delay. Need to combine with light therapy ASAP: the same day as the injection, adapt the light/dark exposure to the new target phase, without any progressivity: "This adaption time to a phase advance was significantly shortened (P &lt; 0.001) to only 4 days when a cordycepin injection was administered at Zeitgeber time 11 (ZT11; light off 1 hour later at ZT12) on each of the first 2 days (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the cordycepin-treated mice adapted significantly faster (P &lt; 0.001) to an 8-hour phase-delay assay (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our results in cells highlighting the importance of cordycepin administration time, we also found that the mice did not show an accelerate behavioral phase-shift phenotype when cordycepin was injected at ZT23 (1 hour before light on; fig. S6)." → hence, no need to time according to target wake up time but rather to current wake up time, as cordycepin seems to break the circadian regulatory feedback loops, so then essentially your body won't know when is the wake up time anymore, and hence will pick up any zeitgeber to synchronize asap.</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image017.png" width="400"> → SUPER IMPRESSIVE difference between cordycepin and saline! (note the right side is the same as the left side, it's simply to better show the transition between 2 consecutive days, but we can see the actimetry data is repeated)</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: only adenosine analogs are type 0 resetters? (in drugs, they didn't test light)</b> "<b>We observed multiple “type 1” phase shifters (defined as &lt;6-hour shift)</b> (23) that may be caused by the range of cell culture perturbations, such as pH and temperature. However, <b>only the adenosine analogs identified and examined in our present study showed the “type 0” phase-shifting phenotype</b>, underlying its mechanistic specificity."</li>
<li>"The ability of cordycepin to penetrate the BBB, its rapid onset effect, and its 12-hour phase reversal phenotype make it appear as a potential candidate as a drug to treat jet lag. Looking beyond treatment of acute circadian clock disorders, one can envision that the ability to reliably therapeutically entrain rhythmicity could help treat a broad swath of known clock-related chronic disorders as well."</li>
<li>"One cannot directly extrapolate the dosing time points from mice to humans. Second, the relatively low potency of cordycepin requires high dosing to the animals to obtain the behavioral effect. It is thus desirable to develop analogs for better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, as well as testing in human cells, before going to clinical examinations."</li>
<li>Pre-clinical test on human cells, so we know it also works in humans! "They found that adenosine derivative cordycepin shifted the circadian phase by <b>12 hours in human cells in vitro</b> and mouse cells ex vivo and accelerated clock acclimation in a mouse model of jet lag."</li>
<li>"Mechanistically, cordycepin acted to modify the clock by <b>preventing the interaction of RUVBL2 and clock gene BMAL1</b>, resulting in the dissociation of a repressive complex at specific chromatin loci and the derepression of clock gene transcription."</li>
<li>"The observed type 0 phase shifts resulted from derepression of E-box clock gene transcription."</li>
<li>"Using simple peripheral injection treatment, we found that <b>cordycepin penetrated the blood-brain barrier</b>" → hence oral intake should be sufficient!</li>
<li><b>BUT ISSUE: dosage is 15mg/kg, hence for an average human of ~70kg, this would be about 1g of cordycepin! Not cordyceps, but pure cordycepin! Review of the literature on dosage safety of cordycepin:</b></li>

Yes that would be correct, but <b>you only need to take cordycepin once</b>, not everyday. Your circadian rhythm would use the next days to progressively pick up on the new zeitgeber cycle, without needing any additional cordycepin.

</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
[In the study](<a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" class="https">https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769</a>), they screened several molecules to find one that is a type-0 resetter, in other words (and according to their definition), a circadian phase reversal drug, which means it can shift the circadian rhythm of more than 6h.

Adenosine is the molecule that is the basis of the homeostatic sleep pressure process S. It's interesting, because according to Borbély's model, the process S is separate from the circadian rhythm process C (mainly regulated with melatonin), and numerous biological experiments have shown evidence of existence for both processes. However, some recent experiments show [an interdependent relationship between both processes](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154</a>), as indeed melatonin has [a weak effect on the process S but stronger on process C](<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" title="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" class="https">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know</a>) as melatonin interacts with both melatonin type 1 and type 2 receptors, the latter being more implicated with process C and type 1 with process S (see [here](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/</a>) and [here](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/</a>)) and on all cells notably [through the mitochondria](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/</a>), and [light was also found to have an effect on both processes C and S](<a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" class="https">https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094</a>) too. So we here have a drug working theoretically on the homeostatic process S which is much more efficient than any other known drug including melatoninergic, which is thought to be the basis of the circadian process C.

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
What did they find in the study? They tested a jet lag model on mice: they injected 15 mg/kg of cordycepin (not 45mg/kg, that's for the next tests) to mice roughly 1h before wake-up on the first day, and then nothing apart from changing the light exposure. The mice needed half less time to adapt their circadian rhythm, and were better adapted, than mice without cordycepin, for both 8h phase advance and phase delay.

If we transposed to humans, the typical scenario would be when you prepare for a flight to another timezone. On the day of the flight, you wake up 1h earlier than your usual wake up time using an alarm clock, then take the appropriate dosage of cordycepin <b>only once</b>. Then you proceed with your day and take your flight to the new timezone. The Cordycepin you took in the morning would then <b>desynchronize</b> your circadian rhythm, so that you can pick up a new cycle fitting the new timezone faster. The new light exposure schedule will be changed when arriving in the new timezone, and your body will use this zeitgeber to pick up the new cycle faster thanks to the forced desynchrony by the cordycepin, which will hopefully allow your circadian rhythm to adapt to the new timezone in about half the time needed without cordycepin. This is super fast, and is why the [authors qualify the drug as "magic"](<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound</a>).

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So that's all nice and all, but is it working on humans? Well, they did not test on humans per se, but they did test on human cells in vitro. That's where they tested between 15mg/kg to 45mg/kg, at different timing, and found that the circadian phase resetting effect of cordycepin does happen with human cells, up to 12h (whereas they only tested 8h with mice), and is time dependent (eg, they tested giving cordycepin 1h before sleeping instead of wake up and it didn't work).
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So that's very promising! But there is an issue: the dosage. Indeed, 15mg/kg of cordycepin as they gave to the mice equals to ~1g for a human weighting 70kg. [This study](<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp" title="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp" class="https">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp</a>) shows that we can expect ~1mg of cordycepin per 1g of mycelium of cordyceps (the mushroom), whether militaris (cheaper) or sinensis (more expensive). In fact, in the fruiting body of cordyceps militaris, we can expect 2.6mg/g of cordycepin/cordyceps, so given militaris is much more affordable, this can be very interesting cost-wise.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
&gt; The mean contents of cordycepin and adenosine in the fruiting bodies of C. militaris were 2.654 ± 0.02 and 2.45 ± 0.03 mg/g, those in C. sinensis were 0.9801 ± 0.01 and 1.643 ± 0.03 mg/g, while those in the mycelium of C. militaris were 0.9040 ± 0.02 and 1.592 ± 0.03 mg/g, respectively. The concentration of cordycepin and adenosine in the fruiting bodies of C. militaris were higher than that in natural C. sinensis, while the fermented mycelium of C. militaris were similar with natural C. sinensis.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Since we assume we need 1g of cordycepin on average for a human to get the circadian phase resetting effects, this means we would need to ingest (and digest!) ~1kg of mycelium of cordyceps, or 377g of fruiting body of cordyceps militaris since it has a higher content. This seems a bit too much for the human body to realistically digest, so likely cordycepin should be obtained in an extracted pure powder form. Also, maybe a lower quantity is needed, the translation from mice to human is not linear so we may need much less for the same effect (or we may need more...).
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
But can it work with oral administration? As the study's authors note, cordycepin passed the blood-brain barrier. Also, it's maybe not necessary to attain the brain, because the cordycepin effect is on the circadian clocks of all cells (and [the pineal gland is not necessary for entrainment](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a>)). [Another study ](<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found" class="https">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found</a> that oral cordycepin, despite not being fully metabolized, does still generate a metabolite called 3′-deoxyinosine which may explain why oral cordycepin may work on adenosine pathways.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Now the question is whether it's safe or not? Has any previous safety clinical trial been conducted on humans with these dosages of cordycepin?
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Well, here we enter into a more muddy territory, as cordycepin is almost a religious substance in some cultures, so it's pretty difficult to get reliable independent and robust studies on its effects and safety profile. But some exist.

Another study (Chen, J. G., Lai, W. Q., Mei, S., FU, Y., &amp; WANG, Y. (2009).

Chin J Health Lab Tech, 19(2), 417-419.) found that the LD50 letal dose for mice was 20g/kg of cordyceps sinensis, and up to 5g/kg there was no observed side effect. According to [a review](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32288794/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32288794/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32288794/</a>) (and a [2nd one](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775778/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775778/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29775778/</a>) and a [3rd one](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324458/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324458/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28324458/</a>)), intraperitoneal injections with doses of cordyceps sinensis up to 80g/kg daily on mice for 7 days did not lead to any fatality. Keep in mind this is for cordyceps, not cordycepin, and hence to do a rough approximation this means that up to 80mg/kg daily was tested on mice with no fatalities for one study, whereas the other found a fatality with 20mg/kg (close to the 15mg/kg the circadian phase resetting study used).

Side-note: although cordyceps militaris is very close biologically to cordyceps sinensis, and hence can probably be used in place for cheaper drug design, there is also potentially [cordyceps cicadae](<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305637/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305637/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305637/</a>).

In conclusion: cordycepin looks very promising, but it's way too early to test that on humans, as the information about its safety is only sparse (mostly on cordyceps instead of cordycepin, with very few clinical trials on cordyceps and none on pure cordycepin), and the dosage used in the circadian phase resetting study is way too high, and hence will need some serious clinical research before [an appropriate safe dosage is found in humans](<a href="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-602/cordyceps" title="https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-602/cordyceps" class="https">https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-602/cordyceps</a>).

<li>BEST: why dark therapy is necessary, a single-case study and protocol by Czeisler et al: <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/233/4764/667/tab-pdf" title="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/233/4764/667/tab-pdf" class="https">https://science.sciencemag.org/content/233/4764/667/tab-pdf</a> or <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3726555/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3726555/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3726555/</a>
<ul>
<li>ME: To summarize, without changing anything else in her life, an elder woman who was a typical sleeper saw a phase delay of 6 hours simply because of light exposure in the evening for a week. That's about a 1h delay per day, a similar quantity observed in what is considered among the most extreme cases of non24. With light alone. That's crazy.</li>
<li>"Because there is an <b>age-related shortening of the internally synchronized free-running period</b> (13), we hypothesized that, on aver' age, the circadian timing system in the elderly would be internally phase advanced with respect to sleep."</li>
<li>BEST: "Our data also support a hierarchical model in which the external light-dark cycle ordinarily synchronizes the endogenous circadian oscillator (6), which in turn governs the internal organization and spontaneous duration of sleep (3, 23). <b>These data are incompatible with alternate models in which sleep must play either a primary or an essential intermediate role in the entrainment of physiologic rhythms.</b>"</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
--&gt; in other words, stabilized (held constant) sleep is NOT a zeitgeber, it's not because sleep is held constant that it will always be, sleep timing is dictated by the circadian rhythm, it's not the other way around!
</div>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>BEST: crazy prediction that turned out to be true! "Also, the magnitude of the change in internal phase relations that we observed implies that <b>bright light must be acting directly on the endogenous circadian process</b> as we had earlier concluded (25)."</li>
<li>BEST: Czseizler protocol for single case study of circadian rhythm: "We have now demonstrated an effective protocol for objectively quantifying changes in the phase position of the circadian pacemaker before and after a therapeutic intervention. This protocol could be used to correlate changes in internal phase relations after intervention (..o.-) with clinical response to treatments aimed at correcting hypothesized abnormalities of circadian phase orientation. This would provide important corroborative evidence for the hypothesized role of circadian dysfunction in affective illness."</li>

<li>long exposure to light, 5h</li>
<li>"The stimulus induced strong (type 0) resetting, with responses <b>highly dependent on the initial circadian phase of light exposure</b>. The magnitude and direction of the phase shifts were modulated by the <b>timing of exposure</b> to <b>ordinary room light</b>, previously thought to be undetectable by the human pacemaker. The data indicate that the sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to light is far greater than previously recognized and have important implications for the therapeutic use of light in the management of disorders of circadian regulation."</li>

These microbiome rhythms appear to be deeply entwined with circadian rhythms—research suggests that both circadian and microbial rhythms are capable of influencing and disrupting the other, with consequences for health and sleep.</li>
</ul>

<b>The rhythms of gut microbes are affected by diet, both the timing of our eating and the composition of the foods we consume.</b> A recent study found that mice eating a healthy diet generated more beneficial gut microbes, and that the collective activity of microbial life in the gut followed a daily—or diurnal—rhythm. That rhythm, in turn, supported circadian rhythms in the animal. Mice fed a high-fat, stereotypically “Western” diet, on the other hand, produced less optimal microbial life. The gut microbes of these mice did not adhere to a daily rhythm themselves, and also sent signals that disrupted circadian rhythms. These mice gained weight and became obese, while the mice that ate healthfully did not.

Scientists bred a third group of mice without any gut microbes at all. These mice had no signals to send from a gut microbiome. Circadian disruption occurred in these mice—but they did not gain weight or suffer metabolic disruption, even when fed the high-fat diet. This suggests a couple of important conclusions. First, that microbial activity is key to normal circadian function—and therefore to sleep. Second, that the microbiome is a key player along with diet in the regulation of weight and metabolism.

<li>"Impaired consciousness ranging from somnolence to confusion, delirium, stupor and coma has been reported in almost 15% of hospitalized patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) [1].

Administration of Melatonin or Melatonin Receptor Agonists (MRA) has been robustly associated with a shortened Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay, reduced prevalence of delirium and improved sleep quality [3].

<li>"Melatonin was initially discovered in and thought to be exclusively a product of the vertebrate pineal gland. However, in consideration of the identification of melatonin in prokaryotic bacteria [8], from which mitochondria evolved (the endosymbiotic theory) and the uncommonly high levels of assayable melatonin in mitochondria [9], it was speculated and eventually documented that this indoleamine is synthesized in this organelle [10]. Given that most cells (a few exceptions) contain <b>mitochondria</b>, <b>it is now believed that melatonin production occurs in most cells in all organisms</b>. This has also been specifically demonstrated in <b>human lung monocytes/macrophages</b> [11]. [...] Aerobic glycolysis is an important feature of highly proinflammatory state since it ensures the necessary high levels of ATP and the abundant supply of biomolecules to ensure synthesis and release of the damaging molecules that constitute the cytokine storm. This increased aerobic glycolysis coupled with the absence of locally-produced melatonin provides the optimal environment (the perfect “cytokine storm”) for the massive tissue damage that occurs in COVID-19 disease.

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: melatonin is a rhythm stabilizer/sleep consolidator?</b> Not a phase shifter (use light therapy for that)? "However, if animals were subjected to an abrupt phase shift (as in jet lag), they adapted faster to the new schedule without a pineal gland (56, 57). <b>This suggested that the pineal, and by inference melatonin, acted as a brake on abrupt changes of phase, these being undesirable in a natural environment.</b> This possibility is reinforced by the fact that suppression of melatonin production by the beta blocker atenolol leads to faster adaptation to light-induced phase-shifts in humans (58). Ironically therefore whilst exogenous melatonin is used to hasten adaptation, it is possible that a function of endogenous production is to do the opposite. [...] The accumulated knowledge on the deleterious effects of abruptly changing time cues in for example shift work and jet lag [e.g., (61–67)] lead to the <b>suggestion that one function of endogenous melatonin is to protect against abrupt short term changes of phase by maintenance of the circadian status quo.</b>" → See also: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589" class="https">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589</a></li>
<li>"Some of the most convincing data linking physiological levels of melatonin with anti-cancer growth concerns human breast cancer-mouse xenograft studies. In a series of experiments Blask et al. could show the protective effects of exogenous and endogenous melatonin and the deleterious effects of extra light (153–156)."</li>
<li>" In humans in one study, the decrease in glucose tolerance from morning to evening was mostly influenced by the endogenous circadian system compared to the sleep-wake cycle. However, in apparent contrast to pinealectomy effects in animals, melatonin administered during day time just prior to a glucose tolerance test in healthy adults clearly impaired glucose tolerance both in the morning and the evening (172, 173), an effect that was dependent on a common gain-of-function variant of the melatonin receptor gene MTNR1B151 (see below). Melatonin may also acutely decrease insulin secretion in cultured human islets (174). Thus, some controversy exists in the literature especially when comparing results in nocturnal rodents with diurnal humans with both beneficial and detrimental effects of melatonin reported. It is intriguing to note that the rare condition 'familial insulin resistance' or Rabden-Mendenhall syndrome is associated with pineal hyperplasia (175, 176)."</li>

<li>"Prolonged exposure of human subjects to a long-night, short-day cycle results in changes in the profile of some circadian rhythms including the melatonin rhythm and slightly increased duration and redistribution of sleep (3, 41). These findings are reminiscent of the effects of photoperiod in other mammalian species (42, 43). In our study, 9 d of exposure to 16-h sleep opportunities did not produce photoperiodic changes in melatonin duration. Comparing these data with those of Wehr and colleagues (3), it may be suggested that the length of time required to observe human photoperiodic responses is between 9 d and 4 wk. Alternatively, it is possible that the sample size used in the present study was not sufficient to detect statistically significant human photoperiodic responses."</li>
<li>"A previous study showed that <b>long-term melatonin administration (1 month, 6 mg) to six healthy male subjects did not alter mean nocturnal LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin-Beta secretion</b> (44)."</li>

<li>"In summary, these findings provide unequivocal evidence that, in the short term, timed melatonin treatment in suitable conditions is a highly effective means of phase-shifting circadian rhythms, without indication of deleterious effects on major aspects of human endocrine function, or daytime sleepiness and mood on the day following administration."</li>

<li>"This study demonstrated that pretreatment with physiological concentrations of melatonin (30-300 pM or 7-70 pg/mL) <b>decreased the number of hMT2 melatonin receptors</b> heterologously expressed in mammalian cells in a <b>time and concentration-dependent manner</b>."</li>
<li>"The decrease in MT2 melatonin receptor number induced by melatonin (300 pM for 1 h) was <b>reversible</b> and reached almost full recovery <b>after 8 h</b>; however, after treatment with <b>10 nM melatonin full recovery was not attained even after 24 h</b>.

<li>"We conclude that in vivo the <b>nightly secretion of melatonin desensitizes endogenous MT2 melatonin receptors in the mammalian SCN thereby providing a temporally integrated profile of sensitivity of the mammalian biological clock to a melatonin signal</b>."</li>
<li>MY SUMMARY: endogenous and exogenous melatonin desensitizes the MT2 melatonin receptors (melatonin type 2), hence if the dosage is too big or the timing incorrect, not only melatonin will be ineffective but also it will be counterproductive and may prevent from sleeping!

<li>"The researchers also discovered that the typical health food store dosage of melatonin, which is about three milligrams (or 10 times the dosage in the study), is less effective in treating insomnia. In addition, the <b>higher dosage can cause</b> potentially serious side effects, including <b>hypothermia</b> (low body temperature). The study also showed that the higher dosage elevated plasma melatonin levels during the day, <b>which can cause a "hangover" effect in some of the subjects</b>."</li>
<li>But this was in older adults, who have lower melatonin levels, and was aimed at treating "age-related insomnia".</li>
<li>"We examined the ability of similar, physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 yr old. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 min before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by 1-wk washout periods."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "The physiologic melatonin dose (0.3 mg) <b>restored sleep efficiency</b> (P &lt; 0.0001), <b>acting principally in the midthird of the night</b>; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P &lt; 0.0008) to normal. The pharmacologic dose (3.0 mg), like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), <b>also improved sleep</b>; however, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours. Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose." → <b>in other words: melatonin helps to avoid fragmented sleep, so that the subject does not wake up too early, and hence reduce the need for naps (which I suspect is a primary characteristic of non24). And whatever the dosage of melatonin. So it's a main effect of melatonin (as suspected by Josephine Arendt, it's a sleep stabilizer, and not a zeitgeber, in other words melatonin avoids too big and abrupt shifts in the circadian rhythm).</b></li>

<li>BEST: age-related insomnia (or rather circadian rhythm disorder) is common! "AGING ALTERS THE regulation of sleep in many individuals (1–3): <b>about 30% of people over age 50 yr exhibit insomnia</b> characterized by decreased total nocturnal sleep time; frequent nocturnal awakenings with difficulty falling back asleep; and early morning awakening. These alterations are associated with increased daytime sleepiness, attention or memory deficits, and changes in mood."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "and <b>melatonin’s ability to restore sleep is, as has been suggested (17), related to the production of hypothermia</b>." → melatonin affects the circadian rhythm directly since it can modulate core body temperature!</li>
<li>BEST: "This change in overnight sleep efficiency was principally due to increased sleep efficiency during <b>the middle portion of the nocturnal sleep period (P = 0.018) and, secondarily, to improvement during the latter third of the night (Fig. 2)</b>. The sleep efficiencies of insomniac subjects <b>were normal during the first third of the night and were unaffected by melatonin during this interval</b>. Melatonin had <b>no behaviorally significant, dose-related effects on total sleep time; number of awakenings; latency to sleep onset; latency to REM sleep; or percent time spent in any of the sleep stages</b> in insomniacs or normal sleepers."</li>
<li>"that physiologic doses of melatonin that raise plasma melatonin to levels within its normal nocturnal range (i.e. 60–200 pg/ml) can significantly improve sleep in people suffering from age-related insomnia; that <b>bedtime melatonin treatment does not modify sleep efficiency or alter sleep architecture in older people in whom sleep already is normal</b>; and that the major effect of the melatonin treatment we provided is observed during the midportion of the nocturnal sleep period."</li>
<li>"<b>insomnia</b> was defined as exhibiting less than <b>85% sleep efficiency</b> (i.e. <b>the ratio of total sleep time to sleep period</b>) <b>or having a total sleep time of less than 6 h during at least three of the seven nights of the evaluation period</b>. Those qualified as normal sleepers had no subjective complaints of sleep alterations and had actigraphically defined sleep efficiencies not less than 90% and total sleep times of at least 7 h per night."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL ME: this would go along my theory that napping is a primary characteristic of non-24, and hence why melatonin is necessary for non24: not so much to phase advance the circadian rhythm, although it helps, but mostly to help in having a full night by reducing the amount of wake-ups in the 2nd part of the night from the middle.</b> This also fits with F data (properly timed and bright light allows to be entrained, but not to have consistently a full night).</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "A significant increase in circulating melatonin levels was detected within an hour of ingesting the hormone; median (interquartile range) peak levels, observed on average within 2 h of treatment, were 84 (59–120) pg/ml, 220 (124–299) pg/ml, or 1370 (957–2440) pg/ml after administration of the 0.1-, 0.3-, or 3.0-mg doses, respectively (Fig. 3). Ten hours after bedtime plasma melatonin levels after ingestion of the 0.1- or 0.3-mg doses were not significantly different from those observed after placebo treatment. However, <b>melatonin levels after ingestion of the 3-mg dose remained significantly elevated through much of the following day</b> (Fig. 3). <b>Administration of the 0.1- or 0.3-mg melatonin doses failed to modify the physiologic nocturnal decline in core body temperature; however, the 3-mg dose significantly lowed the group minimum core body temperature</b> (P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 4)."</li>
<li><b>→ SUMMARY ME CRITICAL: melatonin affects under 1 hour of exogenous melatonin intake, but peak 2h later (hence why need to take 2-4h before DLMO for phase advance), and only high dosage can modify core body temperature (modify Tmin) but at the expense of residually elevated melatonin levels the next day at least, which may produce long term desensitization. THEORY: with high dosage, we risk desensitization, but we may be able to fully control the melatonin profile (and core body temperature), at the expense of being completely reliant on exogenous melatonin. Proof that suggests that's the case: high dosage melatonin produces a hang-over with hypothermia as shown in this study, this explains why high dosage melatonin causes one to sleep longer than necessary! (also </b><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="this study" class="https">this study</a><b> recommend the same: to use high dosage for more efficiency, unless hang-over needs to be avoided).</b></li>
<li>"pharmacological doses of melatonin do not increase the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin above those achieved by physiological doses and might even be less effective" → WRONG: only the highest dosage 3mg had an impact on the core body temperature, which is a way better marker of the circadian rhythm than melatonin profile! Their study used sleep efficiency as a proxy for results on sleep, but they did NOT study the effect on phase advance and the circadian rhythm, so for the treatment of CRSWD (especially if treatment resistance), high dosage may be useful, this study says nothing about that!</li>

<li>Up to 2mg probably ok, unlikely to lead to desensitization: "Or they might try one of the sustained-release melatonin preparations generally available, which purportedly provide a high enough total dose <b>(e.g. 1.0 or 2.0 mg16,17) to elevate plasma melatonin for most of the night, but probably not so much as would produce desensitizing peak levels</b>." → Valdispert 1.9mg likely won't produce desensitization even (if desensitization can really happen).</li>

<li>BEST: MT1 receptor not desensitized by usual doses of exogenous melatonin, but MT2 is desensitized at any dosage, even physiological/endogenous ones! "Exposure to melatonin can cause the prolonged desensitization of both of its receptors: <b>MT1 receptors require supraphysiologic melatonin concentrations to become internalized</b>12,13 —and thus unresponsive—but the <b>MT2 receptor transiently becomes desensitized even after exposure to the melatonin concentrations occurring normally at nighttime</b>.14 It can be speculated that MT2 receptor desensitization provides a feedback mechanism that limits the neural effects of nighttime melatonin concentrations, and that <b>too-high doses of supplemental melatonin will desensitize both MT1 and MT2 receptors, thereby paralyzing any contribution of the melatonin system to sleep until normal receptor sensitivity has been restored.</b>13,15"</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: why melatonin is different from sleeping pills, because it does not affect GABA receptors, and hence does not affect REM sleep nor the distribution of sleep stages:</b> "Both are mediated by its activation of two specific melatonin receptors, known as MT1 and MT2, on the surface of brain neurons that are concentrated within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, (which is also known to control sleep and circadian rhythms1). <b>The melatonin receptors differ from those for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through which most hypnotic agents act.

<li>0.3 mg is same levels as endogenous melatonin levels (in elder adults), 1mg is above (supraphysiological). "Melatonin blood levels following administration of an oral dose of 0.3 mg reach approximately the same levels as seen endogenously in humans at night [41]. However, <b>in humans, doses of melatonin from 1 mg and up will increase the blood levels several times above physiological plasma melatonin levels</b> [41]."</li>
<li>"exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of melatonin (100 nM) causes an increase in MT1 receptor density, with a concurrent decrease in affinity and functional sensitivity [39]. <b>While the desensitization is significant, no internalization or loss of MT1 melatonin membrane receptors in CHO cells is observed [39].</b> This observation <b>differentiates the effects of melatonin on MT1 from that on MT2</b>, which has a completely different response to <b>acute exposure to high concentrations or prolonged exposure to physiological concentrations</b> (Fig. 7)."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "<b>Desensitization and/or internalization of MT2 melatonin receptors affects the melatonin-mediated phase shift of circadian rhythms [40].

<li>Both MT1 and MT2 receptors can phase shift, although it's more clear with MT2, a role for MT1 cannot be excluded. For now, we aren't sure what are the respective roles of both receptors.

<li>ME: "Also interestingly, the optimal time depends on the dosage of melatonin (and I guess the individual's sensitivity to melatonin). With 5mg (stronger dose), you can take it 2h before DLMO, whereas for 0.5mg (lower dose) it had the most effect when taken 4h before DLMO. And interestingly again, when each dose was taken at their respective optimal point, the amount of phase advance was the same (a bit more than 1h, similarly to van Geijlswijk's paper)." → both dosages produce similar phase advance if properly timed, so this also suggests that there is no desensitization (note that the study was over 2 sessions of 3 days each!)</li>
<li>"Alternatively, it is possible that by timing the administration of a single melatonin pill per day, at the same clock time, we may have not observed the maximum advance and delay that each melatonin dose can produce. This is because, after the first melatonin pill, the circadian clock and associated melatonin PRC likely shifted, meaning that the second and third pills fell on slightly different parts of the melatonin PRC. Thus, a fixed administration time would exclude the possibility of all three melatonin pills falling exactly on the peak advance or peak delay portions of the melatonin PRCs. Nonetheless, in 3 d we did observe larger maximum advances than those seen after a single melatonin dose of 0.5 mg (0.7 h in Ref. 10) and 5 mg (0.4 h in Ref. 12 ; 0.7 h in Ref. 13). Future studies that incorporate such a gradually shifting time of melatonin administration (e.g. Ref. 14) are needed to determine whether in optimal circumstances larger supraphysiological doses of exogenous melatonin can in fact produce larger phase shifts."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: how to calculate the optimal timing for exogenous melatonin intake:</b> "Although the DLMO is widely regarded as the most reliable circadian phase marker currently available (8, 15), it is not yet readily accessible to the general public. Thus, when the timing of an individual’s DLMO is not known, PRCs that are plotted relative to the DLMO (3, 4, 16) must be translated to be relative to sleep times. For example, because the Lewy 0.5 mg PRC indicates that peak advances occur about 3 h before the DLMO (see curve fit in Fig. 1 in Ref. 17), we previously administered 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before bedtime, assuming that there was 2 h between the individual’s DLMO and bedtime (18). <b>However, there is variability in the DLMO-to-bedtime interval. In a large sample, we found that the mean DLMO-to-bedtime interval was 2.7 h, and the range varied from −0.3 to 5.8 h (19). Indeed, 60% of the sample had a DLMO-to-bedtime interval outside of 2–3 h.</b> Therefore, to increase the practicality of our PRCs, we have replotted them relative to sleep midpoint (Figs. 3 and 55). <b>These PRCs show that maximum advances occur when 0.5 mg is taken about 10 h before sleep midpoint and when 3.0 mg of melatonin is taken about 11 h before sleep midpoint.</b> <b>Maximal delays occur when it is taken near the end of sleep and in the morning.</b></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 90pt'>
<b>We recommend that when the DLMO is known, PRCs plotted relative to the DLMO should be used instead of PRCs plotted relative to sleep midpoint. This is because bed and wake times are more readily influenced by social factors and can vary greatly between weekends and weekdays. Sleep midpoint may approximate circadian phase better than bedtime or wake time, but probably not as well as the DLMO.</b>"

<li>ME SUMMARY: Just for info if it can be useful: after parsing a lot of papers on the dosage of melatonin, there are 3 major things that pop out: 1- 0.3mg (or even 0.1mg) is enough to get some phase advance effect. 2- but 1-3mg work even better as they cause hypothermia (but also a hangover on the next day because any dosage &gt;= 1mg causes supraphysiologic levels of melatonin in the blood, which carries over to the next day - hence you may feel some drowsiness). 3- melatonin's role is mostly to consolidate the 2nd half of the sleep, so that you can sleep a whole night (or day depending on your circadian rhythm). It's a sleep stabilizer, not a zeitgeber. Hence, it's normal to have a deeper and longer sleep with it, that's (one of) the natural purposes of melatonin.

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: melatonin without other zeitgebers can phase shift (advance) up to 3h over 3 days! Also suggests strongly that when melatonin (and light) don't work for non24 or DSPD it's probably because of other conflicting mistimed zeitgebers (eg, sunlight)!</b> "More specifically, both PRCs indicate that <b>peak advances occur 3–3.5 h before the DLMO</b>. Both PRCs also show a broad range of delays. These similarities are quite remarkable, considering the two PRCs were generated with markedly different protocols (although with similar DLMO thresholds of approximately 3 pg/ml) and that the Lewy PRC was generated in the field, whereas our PRC was generated in the laboratory under more controlled conditions.</li>

By contrast, despite the Lewy PRC having an additional day of melatonin administration, <b>our PRC shows larger maximum phase shifts of about 2–3 h,</b> whereas the Lewy PRC showed maximum phase shifts of about 1.5 h.

This approach can phase shift the clock without causing extreme circadian misalignment between the clock and the sleep/wake schedule, and thus avoids the associated jet-lag type symptoms and negative consequences of abrupt shifts of sleep. <b>By gradually changing the times of administration, the bright light and melatonin are more likely to hit the optimal times on their PRCs as they shift.</b> <b>We have observed that on average, the combination of afternoon melatonin and morning bright light are additive and produce the largest advances</b> (18)."</li>

<li><b>BEST: higher dosage (3.0 mg) is confirmed to be preferable for substantial phase shift such as for CRSWD!</b> "Our recommendations on what dose of melatonin to use to phase shift vary according to each individual’s circumstance.

<li>BEST PUBLIC REF: need 2-4h before DLMO, hence 4-6h before natural bedtime: "Timing is key. Don’t take melatonin right before bed because it takes several hours for it to become effective.

<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
for the moment, it was shown that targeting MT2 leads to greater phase advances, whether or not MT1 is knocked out or stimulated<br>
but MT1 can modulate the response of MT2, so it's more intricate and complicated to say for sure whether or not targeting MT1 can be useful for us

<li>BEST REVIEW: "Currently, only one melatonin receptor agonist, tasimelteon, is approved for the treatment of a CRSWD: non–24‐hour sleep‐wake disorder (or non‐24). However, three additional commercially available melatonin receptor agonists—<b>agomelatine, prolonged‐release melatonin, and ramelteon</b>—have been investigated for potential use for treatment of CRSWDs. Data indicate that these melatonin receptor agonists have distinct pharmacologic profiles that may help clarify their clinical use in CRSWDs. We review the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of these melatonin agonists and summarize their efficacy profiles when used for the treatment of CRSWDs." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/</a>
<ul>
<li>"Two of these compounds, ramelteon and tasimelteon, are approved by the FDA and available commercially in the United States, and three compounds—agomelatine, prolonged‐release melatonin, and tasimelteon—are approved by the European Medicines Agency and are commercially available in Europe."</li>
<li>Prolonged release melatonin: "2 mg/day, 1–2 hr before going to bed and <b>after food</b>", to treat sleep efficiency in elder adults.</li>
<li>Ramelteon and Tasimelteon also without food after!</li>
<li>"Agomelatine binds to MT1 and MT2 receptors with approximately equal affinity and is distinctive in that it has additional antagonist properties at the serotonin receptor subtype (5‐HT2c).40 Ramelteon exhibits a 10‐fold greater affinity for MT1 than MT2,59 and prolonged‐release melatonin exhibits an 8‐fold greater affinity for MT1 than MT2.39 Tasimelteon is the only one of these four compounds that shows a greater affinity for MT2 than MT1, with the difference being 4‐fold.58"</li>
<li>Agomelatine for both CRSWD and depression treatment (major depressive disorder): "The additional binding and antagonism of the 5‐HT2C receptor with the melatonin receptor binding of agomelatine is hypothesized to contribute to its efficacy in treating major depressive disorder."</li>
<li>BEST: "The primary metabolites of both agomelatine and prolonged‐release melatonin are biochemically inactive; therefore, <b>the timing and duration of the activity of these drugs fully depend on the properties of the parent compounds.</b>" → this is why by crushing prolonged release pills, it becomes the same as instant/fast/immediate release melatonin, because the parent compound that is used to delay the effect is the crushed so the primary metabolite is directly bio accessible.</li>
<li>"<b>Prolonged‐release melatonin and ramelteon</b>, each indicated for insomnia, <b>show a much higher MT1 binding affinity that may contribute to the reported soporific effects of these drugs.</b>" → plus combined with high dosage that produces a carry-on (hang-over) effect the next day with blood melatonin levels staying higher than normals, this may explain why there is a soporific effect indeed.</li>
<li>BEST: see Table 6: Evidence for the Use of Approved Melatonin Receptor Agonists for the Treatment of Circadian Rhythm Sleep‐Wake Disorders</li>
<li>"Persistent daytime sleepiness occurred throughout ramelteon monotherapy"</li>
<li>"Sleep latency, sleep onset and offset times, number and duration of naps, CGI‐C score, and WHO‐5 scores were not significantly different between groups" with prolonged release melatonin</li>

<li>BEST REVIEW on pharmacodynamics of melatoninergic agonists: "Melatoninergic agonists do not cause next-day hangover and withdrawal effects, or dependence.

<ul>
<li>BEST: guts/intestines is the biggest producer of melatonin, hence it's obvious that any effective CRSWD therapy should account for food intake composition and timing: "<b>Additional variation may result from the gut, which is both a source and sink of melatonin</b>,53–56 allows enterohepatic cycling of this compound,55–58 <b>contains by two orders of magnitude more melatonin than the pineal gland</b>,54 <b>and can release melatonin in terms of a postprandial response</b>.54,55,59 <b>Gastrointestinal release of melatonin in response to tryptophan was associated with profound sleep promoting effects.</b>53" → Postprandial sleepiness due to melatonin release!!! WTF!!!!</li>
<li>"<b>Since acute phase shifting and facilitation of sleep onset are also achieved by immediate-release melatonin</b>, advantages of prolonged-release melatonin or longer-acting synthetic analogs should rather be sought in the treatment of primary chronic insomnia."</li>
<li>"For reasons mentioned, the use of agomelatine should be only considered in conjunction with depression."</li>
<li>BEST: tolerance and addiction of melatonin: "In full agreement with numerous findings on immediate-release melatonin, all studies on the prolonged-release formulation <b>unanimously show that the recommended dose does not cause next-day hangover</b>, but rather favors morning alertness – although some exceptions have been described in other investigations using different doses. <b>It does not lead to dependence, early or late withdrawal effects after discontinuation.</b>51,77–79 <b>The development of tolerance is usually absent with melatonin</b>, although a few exceptions have been reported, especially in some children with neurological disorders.91–94 Should the development of tolerance turn out to be a consequence of altered metabolism, which remains to be demonstrated, other melatoninergic agonists might be tested. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study on prolonged-release melatonin confirmed the absence of next-day impairments of psychomotor functions, driving skills and memory recall, in contrast to 10 mg zolpidem.109 Controlled-release melatonin (2 mg) was successfully used even for facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation.110</li>

Like melatonin, ramelteon did not cause next-day hangover (as revealed by subjective feeling, psychomotor and cognitive tests, and ability to concentrate),105 rebound insomnia or other withdrawal effects, or development of tolerance or addiction.20–22,105 Under these conditions, both prolonged-release melatonin and ramelteon appear safe in short-term treatment, as may be assumed for other exclusively melatoninergic drugs in general."

<li>"At recommended doses51 and even higher, melatonin is devoid of mutagenicity or carcinogenicity, but instead appears to be protective in this regard.38,44,49,55,129 The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity is also reported for ramelteon.125"</li>
<li>Melatonin counter-indication: "Precautions are necessary in subjects with immunological disorders, since melatonin is also a mainly stimulatory immunomodulator.19,45,49 Thus, melatoninergic drugs should generally not be prescribed to patients with autoimmune diseases.51 "</li>
<li>"<b>Melatonin and all synthetic melatoninergic drugs discussed here are capable of phase shifting the circadian pacemaker, and all of them can be expected to reduce sleep onset latency, with the exception of a certain number of nonresponders.</b>" → this includes melatonin, ramelteon, tasimelteon and agomelatine. So nothing special, but indeed if a drug doesn't work for you you may want to try another one.</li>
<li>Recommended dose of Circadian is 2mg</li>
<li>BEST: postprandial sleepiness due to melatonin?
<ul>
<li>BEST: " In humans, the <b>transient postprandial elevation of blood concentrations of melatonin may be the cause of sleepiness often experienced after the midday meal</b> (47). This could account for the popularity of “siesta,” the midday napping time. As melatonin was also found to cool down the core body temperature (119–121), it can explain why siesta is most popular in the hot areas of the globe.</li>

<b>A reduction in caloric intake increased the lifespan of mice. The same effect was achieved when mice were fed melatonin</b> (122). As melatonin concentrations in various segments of the gastrointestinal tract increased in fasting animals (39, 74) it can be speculated that the increase of longevity in animals fed a low-calorie diet is due to their high production of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract (39, 74). What could be the mechanism that increases the lifespan of mice with high melatonin levels? As stated previously, melatonin protects organisms against hydroxyl radicals (7). It has been speculated that lower blood levels of melatonin found in old people (123, 124) may be accountable for some symptoms of aging. It can therefore be hypothesized that an elevation of melatonin to youthful levels, induced by a hypocaloric diet, increases the antioxidant capacity of the organism and thus slows down the aging process." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a> sourced from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093</a>

<li>Melatonin, food intake and digestion: "Implants of melatonin in mice increased their food consumption (53). An increase of melatonin concentrations in peripheral blood of animals refed after fasting was reported in several studies (39, 74, 114). In addition, elevated melatonin levels were detected in human saliva after supper (115). The sudden pulse of melatonin released from the gut may be the cause of a shift in biological rhythms ( (such as locomotion, temperature, and cortisol rhythm in blood) observed after food intake (116, 117). <b>This shift in rhythms is not mediated by the pineal gland, as the destruction of the suprachiasmatic nucleus</b> (the brain area regulating the rhythmic secretion of melatonin in the pineal) <b>had no effect on such a shift</b> (118)." → melatonin is not a zeitgeber??? False lead??? Or rather the pineal gland is NOT managing the shift in circadian rhythm due to melatonin, maybe melatonin influences the cells directly since mitochondria process it. But still not a zeitgeber, it's a biological rhythm marker. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a> sourced from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093</a></li>
<li>"When given during the day, a high dose of melatonin would cause mild narcotic effects, drowsiness etc. and the practice is not recommended for this reason.

Although early birds are typically viewed as more productive, likely because their natural rhythm fits more closely with a 9-5 job, having a range of chronotypes in the workplace can be beneficial. In the laboratory, for example, the discovery of one protein was thrown into doubt when two opposing chronotypes performed the same experiment. When the ‘owl’ postdoc did the experiments in the evening, the protein was there, but when the ‘lark’ PhD student performed the same experiments in the morning, the protein was nowhere to be found.

<li>"The circadian clock controls daily oscillations of gene expression at the cellular level. We report the development of a high-throughput circadian functional assay system that consists of luminescent reporter cells, screening automation, and a data analysis pipeline. We applied this system to further dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian circadian clock using a chemical biology approach. We analyzed the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds with diverse structures on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. Our screening paradigm identified many compounds previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, <b>we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consistently caused a strong short period phenotype in contrast to the well-known period lengthening by lithium</b>, another presumed GSK-3 inhibitor. <b>siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK-3β also caused a short period, confirming the phenotype obtained with the small molecule inhibitors</b>. These results clarify the role of GSK-3β in the period regulation of the mammalian clockworks and highlight the effectiveness of chemical biology in exploring unidentified mechanisms of the circadian clock."</li>

<li>BEST REVIEW and BEST INTRO: Circadian Misalignment and Health, 2014 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/#!po=4.97382" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/#!po=4.97382" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/#!po=4.97382</a>

<li>"Therefore, these external zeitgeibers or “time givers” such as light, endogenous melatonin and to a <b>lesser extent physical and social activity</b> are important factors for synchronizing the circadian rhythm to the 24-hour day (Baehr et al., 2003; Barger, Wright, Hughes, &amp; Czeisler, 2004; Goel, 2005). The timing of these zeitgeibers is highly important, in that they will have a different effect on the circadian rhythm depending on the time of exposure (Khalsa, Jewett, Cajochen, &amp; Czeisler, 2003; Kripke, Elliott, Youngstedt, &amp; Rex, 2007; Lewy, 2007)."</li>
<li>"Circadian rhythms are coordinated by the SCN or “master clock”, however <b>the molecular mechanism of the clock is present in every cell of the body</b>. Circadian or clock genes (in humans- e.g. CLOCK, CRY, PER, BMAL) comprise an autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loop which demonstrates a cycle every 24 hours (Hardin, Hall, &amp; Rosbash, 1990; Loros &amp; Dunlap, 1991). <b>In addition to individual cells, rhythms are also generated among organs including the heart, stomach, liver and pancreas</b> (Dibner, Schibler, &amp; Albrecht, 2010). Circadian patterns are also present among physiological systems, including the cardiovascular and renal systems (Dibner et al., 2010; Gachon, Nagoshi, Brown, Ripperger, &amp; Schibler, 2004). <b>These peripheral rhythms have a unique phase relationship with the master clock which is coordinated through neuronal pathways, neuropeptides and hormones. Several excellent reviews have been published on this topic</b> (Bass, 2012; Brown &amp; Azzi, 2013; Zelinski, Deibel, &amp; McDonald, 2014)."</li>
<li>"By the Oxford Dictionary, misalignment refers to “the incorrect arrangement or position of something in relation to something else”. One of the most common types of misalignment studied is misalignment of the sleep-wake cycle in relation to the biological night. <b>Other types of misalignment include misalignment of feeding rhythms to the sleep-wake or light-dark cycle, or internal misalignment of central and peripheral rhythms.</b>" → <b>entraining the SCN with light and melatonin is not sufficient! Need also food timing to entrain the peripheral clocks!</b></li>
<li>"Individuals with evening chronotype (preference for later timing of sleep and activity) have been shown in some studies to have a shorter phase angle between circadian markers and sleep, indicating that <b>they sleep and wake earlier in their circadian phase</b> (Duffy, Rimmer, &amp; Czeisler, 2001; Mongrain, Carrier, &amp; Dumont, 2006). " → DSPD to adapt to social needs tends to sleep earlier than their circadian rhythm, compared to early sleepers. So they put more efforts in fact!</li>
<li>"One of the most significant and immediate consequences of misalignment of the sleep-wake cycle to the biological night is sleep disturbance and/or daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, difficulty waking in the morning and sleepiness caused by circadian misalignment are typical symptoms that lead patients to seek care in sleep clinics for circadian disorders. However, the physiological and psychological consequences are much broader than sleep-wake disturbance. These include changes in feeding patterns, metabolic function and risk for mood disorders. Other types of disruption include internal misalignment of rhythms, such as timing of central vs. peripheral clocks. For example, research in animal models has demonstrated that altering availability of food timing shifts peripheral (e.g. hepatic) but not central rhythms (Stokkan, Yamazaki, Tei, Sakaki, &amp; Menaker, 2001)."</li>
<li>"In a forced desynchrony protocol to <b>simulate the experience of living on mars</b>, individuals were assigned to a 24 hour day or a <b>24.6 hour day</b> for 25 days. <b>Interestingly, some individuals were capable of entraining their circadian rhythms and others were not</b> (Gronfier, Wright, Kronauer, &amp; Czeisler, 2007; Wright, Hughes, Kronauer, Dijk, &amp; Czeisler, 2001). <b>Results indicated that those who were non-entrained had poorer sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and had lower leptin during wakefulness. Results from a later study also demonstrated decreased leptin and higher glucose response to meals despite higher insulin production associated with this misalignment</b> (Scheer, Hilton, Mantzoros, &amp; Shea, 2009). Most recently, a study compared 3 days of phase advance to three days of phase delay (21 hour day versus a 27 hour day), with a 4 week wash out period in between the two conditions (Gonnissen, Hursel, Rutters, Martens, &amp; Westerterp-Plantenga, 2012). Results demonstrated that in the <b>phase delay condition, total sleep time was related to levels of insulin and insulin resistance.</b> In a later analysis, it was determined that specifically, <b>decreased REM in the second half of the night was predictive of changes in cortisol, insulin and insulin resistance</b> (Gonnissen et al., 2013). Since REM is modulated by the circadian clock, this suggests a role of circadian misalignment in the metabolic changes reported in this study."</li>
<li>"The circadian rhythm of mood has been demonstrated in multiple studies (Wirz-Justice, 2008). These daily variations in mood have been studied in forced desynchrony and have been demonstrated to have a significant circadian pattern as well as an interaction with prior wakefulness, in that the trough of mood was lowest around the time of the core body temperature minimum and also deteriorated over the wake period (Boivin et al., 1997)."</li>
<li>BEST: circadian syndrome: "<b>Mice fed during the light period (biological night) consumed the same number of calories but gained twice as much weight as mice fed during the dark period</b> (Arble et al., 2009)."</li>
<li>"Large epidemiologic surveys demonstrate that <b>chronotype is a characteristic with a normal bell-shaped distribution that varies by age and gender</b>, in that the young and old demonstrate earlier chronotype and adolescents and young adults demonstrate a later chronotype (Roenneberg et al., 2007)."</li>
<li>Diabetes and obesity linked with chronotype and misalignment</li>
<li>"To date, there is only one study published evaluating chronotype and misalignment and cancer. In a recent study, breast cancer survivors had a shorter disease free interval in metastatic breast cancer if bedtimes were “misaligned”(Hahm et al., 2014) as well as in individuals with later chronotype. Both chronotype and misalignment were independent predictors of disease free interval. This study defined misalignment as a self-reported bedtime earlier or later than the preferred bedtime. Further research is needed to determine the role of chronotype in cancer incidence, disease progression and treatment outcomes."</li>
<li>"In a sense, <b>social jetlag is a measure of misalignment between the individual’s schedule for work and their internal schedule</b>. Epidemiologic research has demonstrated that <b>most individuals have shifts in their sleep between workdays and free days</b> (Roenneberg et al., 2007; Roenneberg, Wirz-Justice, &amp; Merrow, 2003).

<li>"Despite most of the population having intermediate to late chronotypes, work and school hours are still in favour of larks, beginning early in the morning and leaving evenings free. As we try to conform to this schedule, the majority of us experience some degree of social jet lag. This is most extreme in the later chronotypes, who are forced to get up well before they would do on a free day. This has consequences beyond sleep: later chronotypes, with greater social jet lag, are associated with greater mental exhaustion and depressed mood, and are more likely to consume caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol." <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" title="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" class="https">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979</a></li>

Although early birds are typically viewed as more productive, likely because their natural rhythm fits more closely with a 9-5 job, having a range of chronotypes in the workplace can be beneficial. In the laboratory, for example, the discovery of one protein was thrown into doubt when two opposing chronotypes performed the same experiment. When the ‘owl’ postdoc did the experiments in the evening, the protein was there, but when the ‘lark’ PhD student performed the same experiments in the morning, the protein was nowhere to be found. The answer? It was rhythmic! By chance, the difference in the lab’s working patterns led to a key discovery.

<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Taking it further, can we even use chronotypes to our advantage? In our ever-more 24/7 society, shift work is a feature of multiple industries – from manufacturing and transportation to the emergency services. In 2015, a study of factory workers used a ‘chronotype-adjusted’ schedule to match shifts with chronotypes. This meant no more early shifts for the late types, and no more late shifts for the early types. The new schedule successfully increased the amount of sleep the workers had on workdays, and they also reported better sleep quality and increased wellbeing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Whilst it may not be practical to reschedule shift work entirely, workplaces could certainly trial similar measures to match working patterns to chronotypes. Even in an office environment, allowing for flexible schedules with ‘core hours’ in the middle of the day where both early and late types meet could improve productivity as everyone works to their own rhythm. After all: the early bird may catch the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese!"

<li>PREJUDICE: Some psychologists push the idea that detrimental health effects and depression of night owls/dspd are due to unhealthy lifestyle choices which also impacts their sleep, when it can totally be the opposite, sleep causing all these factors! Ultimate attribution bias: "Still, Kripke cautions that night owls are also more likely to have lifestyle habits that disturb sleep — poor eating habits, lack of regular exercise, and alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use — which could also put them at a greater risk for depression and other health problems. Knutson’s own work supports this idea. In 2018, she and her colleagues found night owls were more likely to die at an earlier age than morning larks." → and Kripke didn't prove anything with that... <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419" title="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419" class="https">https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419</a></li>
<li>"The real danger, Knutson thinks, is that <b>the modern world caters to morning larks</b> — night owls have to fight their innate sleep timing in order to fit in. “Trying to be a night owl in a morning lark world can affect how you sleep, how you eat, and how you exercise — all things we know can affect mood and overall health.”</li>

Rather than fighting your chronotype, she recommends people try to live in sync with their body’s natural circadian rhythms.<br>
“<b>It’s hard to fight your circadian rhythms</b>,” she says, noting that doing so means fundamentally resynchronizing them. “You can do it with a rigid sleep schedule and avoiding light at the wrong times, but it takes very consistent, very disciplined behavior.”"

<li>«“During a two-week inpatient experiment involving a dozen adults, some participants were asked to read on an iPad for four hours each night before bedtime, for five consecutive nights. Others read printed books in dim light. After a week, the groups switched.” The results – participants using iPads had reduced levels of melatonin, took longer to fall asleep, and spent less time in restorative rapid-eye movement sleep.» <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/12/22/ipads-tablets-smartphones-disrupt-good-sleep-study-finds/?postshare=7671419364931376" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/12/22/ipads-tablets-smartphones-disrupt-good-sleep-study-finds/?postshare=7671419364931376" class="http">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/12/22/ipads-tablets-smartphones-disrupt-good-sleep-study-finds/?postshare=7671419364931376</a></li>

This is how the Uvex S0360X performs:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24_files/41I6gqnTN0L._SL1600_.jpg" width="300"><br>
Review for the Uvex S0360X: «As a researcher in the field of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, I was ecstatic to find that people were using these glasses to improve sleep and adjust their circadian rhythm. For those who may not be aware, here's a brief explanation on why these would work: Our bodies are programmed to release melatonin during the night. With the advent of artificial light, we can expose our eyes to light during the night. When your eyes are exposed to light during night, melatonin release is shut down, disrupting your daily circadian rhythm (your brain thinks it's daytime when it is really night time), making it difficult to fall asleep. The receptors in your eyes that will convey the signal to halt melatonin release are most sensitive to light in the blue spectrum, providing an opportunity to prevent circadian disruption.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that putting on these glasses in the middle of the day will make you fall asleep. I won't go into the details, but these will only be effective for people who stay up well past sunset (9:00 PM or later) and expose themselves to bright light (TV, computer, most room light). They could also be used by shift workers or people suffering jetlag trying to shift their circadian rhythms, but that is not simple, as there are many factors that go into modifying circadian rhythms correctly, and one could just as easily make things worse.
</p>

<p>
I try to wear these about an hour before bedtime, because I'm usually looking a computer screen or TV. By blocking out light, and specifically blue light, wearing these glasses helps me fall asleep much quicker, and prevents blue light from disrupting my circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
The only downside is you will look like a mad scientist wearing them around the house. Also, anything blue colored will look gray and I can not differentiate between yellow and white text (major problem for anyone playing Diablo 3).<br>
As another reviewer also mentioned, if you wear glasses, these won't easily fit over your glasses. It barely works for me, and I have small frames.»

<h3>Sleep deprivation</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>“Studies show that over time, people who are getting six hours of sleep, instead of seven or eight, begin to feel that they’ve adapted to that sleep deprivation -- they’ve gotten used to it,” Gehrman says. “But if you look at how they actually do on tests of mental alertness and performance, they continue to go downhill. So there’s a point in sleep deprivation when we lose touch with how impaired we are.” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" class="https">https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T</a></li>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and brain damage</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll incur some minor brain damage.</li>
</ul>
It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells. Also, a study in the journal SLEEP found that just one all-nighter resulted in signs of brain tissue loss. Study researcher Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, said in a statement, “Our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neurodegenerative processes.”<br>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and weight gain/metabolic syndrome diseases</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Your insulin sensitivity will be a similar degree as if you had been on a high-fat diet for 6 months.</li>
</ul>
You read that right. According to a study out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, one night of bad sleep lowers our body’s sensitivity to insulin in a similar degree as 6 months on a high-fat diet. A decrease in sensitivity to insulin or “insulin resistance” makes your body unable to keep blood sugar stable, which can eventually lead to Type 2 diabetes. (Note: The study was conducted on dogs, but it’s still very telling.)<br>

Sleep and wakefulness regulation
Conceptually, 2 processes govern sleep and wakefulness:

The homeostatic drive to sleep (process S) is proportional to the duration of sleep restriction and becomes maximal at about 40 hours.
Circadian regulation (process C) creates a drive for wakefulness that variably opposes process S and depends upon intrinsic rhythms.14
Neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus exert master coordination of this sleep/wake rhythm, along with other behavioral and physiologic variables.15 Because the typical intrinsic period is slightly longer than 24 hours, synchronization to the 24-hour day (entrainment) is accomplished by environmental inputs (zeitgebers, or “time givers”), the most important of which is exposure to light.

«We postulated that patients with DSP insomnia had an inadequate capacity to achieve phase advance shifts of the circadian pacemaker which times the sleep-wake cycle. Chronotherapy was therefore designed to reset these patients' biological clocks by the phase delay route.»<br>
Also knew that hypnotics sleeping pills as a unitary treatment for all sleep disorders was a fallacy already in 1975s, and that they were bad for health: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
BUT makes sense that it should be easier, since human circadian clock is &gt; 24h, so delaying is easier than advancing and should ALWAYS be possible (but long term effect of being able to synchronize and MAINTAIN it is another story): This «is because delay shifts (in contrast to phase advances) are not solely dependent on the phase shifting capacity, but rather proceed in a direction common to the endogenous drift (Fig. 1) of the free-running human sleep-wake cycle. » <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
«This relatively rapid rate of phase delay was chosen to minimize the chance that the internal phase delay of the endogenous circadian system in response to the change of schedule would exceed the external phase delay shift being imposed. This would have only perpetuated the condition. Conversely, if the capacity of their circadian timing system to phase delay were exceeded on an i,mposed 27 hr day, the circadian rhythms in these patients would return to their presumably greater than 24 hr free-running period and therefore proceed in the same direction as their imposed rotation around the clock.»<br>

<li>bouger d'un seul coup à l'heure visee ne fait que causer sleep deprivation: «Note that when his scheduled sleep episodes were acutely advanced to the times he desired (from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on days 51 - 52), he spent almost all of both nights awake. His sleep efficiency was only 19.5% on night 51, rising to a mere 41.6% on night 52, notwithstanding the significant level of prior sleep deprivation at that point. This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities. Such sleeplessness even under the favorable laboratory conditions of quiet isolation and absolute darkness verifies his reported difficulty sleeping at those desired hours.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
<li>«It is of special interest to note that during this imposition of a 27 hr day, the patient's actual sleep became more and more interrupted toward the latter half of each bedrest episode. This is in marked contrast to the sleep records from the subject illustrated in Fig. 1 (days 21- 52), who continued to maintain consolidated sleep episodes while free-running on a 25.3 hr day.» → signe qu'on pousse trop, mais on peut forcer. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«These increasing periods of final awakening in case B indicate that the imposed day length of 27 hr (T = 27 hr) was beyond the upper limit of the ROE of his sleep-wake cycle (see Fig. 3). Fortunately, as we suggested earlier (in the Rationale), in such a circumstance the circadian rhythms of the patient should begin to free-run with a greater than 24 hr period. This indeed appears to have happened during stabilization (days 66-74), when the period of consolidated sleep extended a bit later into each scheduled sleep episode on successive nights, being nearly complete by the last three. These results highlight the importance of close adherence to the schedule during stabilization even if the patient encounters sleeplessness, since the rhythms are still in the process of reentrainment.» → confirme ce que j'ai testé. Donc pas ideal durant chronotherapy, sleep efficiency en prend un coup pendant 14j.<br>

<li>«However, recent evidence (J. Elliott, personal communication) indicates that PRC amplitude can actually be affected by prior conditions. It is therefore conceivable that recurrent phase shifts may contribute to the condition of DSPS.» → à force de phase shifter on devient dsps avec plus de facilités à phase delay que advance? et avec reduced env cues on devient non24?</li>
<li>BEST: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«Patients could be instructed to rigidly adhere to their desired, fixed bedtimes and wake times regardless of whether they slept during that period. They could then be assured that (like Mills' normal subjects discussed above), they would eventually adapt to the new schedule. However, it would be unlikely that most such patients would be able to adhere to the schedule during the prolonged period required (probably greater than 2 weeks) without very intense supervision. Even with such supervision, many would be unable to tolerate the discomfort resulting from sleep deprivation and internal dissociation (similar to the jet lag syndrome).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a> mirror: <a href="./SleepNon24_files/Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" title=".\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" class="file">.\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf</a><br>

BEST WARNING ME: this is based on one study of someone who delayed his sleep phase BECAUSE of external stress factors, thus he was compensating, not doing a controlled chronotherapy. And it's not the chronotherapy that led to non24, it's the fact that while being delayed, the sleep efficiency decreased, thus the subject was not resting properly, and as a consequence the internal clock delayed continuously until finding the correct time to have a good sleep! So the interpretation is totally the opposite, and non24 might be a mechanism in fact to find the correct sleep schedule that maximizes sleep efficiency! Thus if not good sleep efficiency, the circadian clock will shift until finding a sweet spot! Thus sleep hygiene might be VERY important to prevent phase shifting and ultimately non24! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881</a>

+ using hypnotics and stimulants not appropriate! + shifting can be a bit chaotic!<br>
«The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.21 The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure.22 Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.23 These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.»<br>

Since DeCoursey's study, Phase response curves might have some differences but it's a highly conservated behavior in all species: «PRCs have been recognized as a universal feature of the mechanism of entrainment to all effective stimuli in a wide variety of species, from unicellular algae to primates.»<br>
Humans have a ROE (range of entrainment, which differs between species and individuals) from 23h to 27h → more range to delay than to advance! To advance, can only do so in increment of max 1h, whereas to delay can do up to 3h! (like in my strategy 5)<br>

Intermittent fasting can affect circadian rhythms in a different way depending on the timing of food availability, suggesting that this regimen affects the SCN clock, similarly to calorie restriction. SCN resetting by intermittent fasting and calorie restriction might be the answer to many chronobiologic misalignments, accounting numerous proofs for the health benefits conferred by these regimens.<br>
Significantly, affecting circadian rhythms impairs the metabolism and cause metabolic disease aetiology, suddenly declining glycaemic control, increasing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. An acute circadian misalignment, for instance, may lift postprandial glucose concentrations by up to 20%, suggesting that preserving circadian coordination is crucial for metabolic welfare [65].<br>
Interestingly, research<br>
groups were able to demonstrate the perturbations of the biological clock during feeding and fasting and how they can intervene pharmacologically at this point. This model can be transposed into current practice by developing models that include the rhythm of diet and exercise to combat metabolic pathologies [17, 68, 85].<br>
Quintessential anabolic rhythms are noticeable in humans early in the morning or around noon, glucose tolerance is optimal, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and the thermic impact of food is more significant in the morning than in the night, leading to daytime being ideal for caloric intake and night time as ideal for resting and fasting, enhancing all secondary offensive mechanisms of glycaemic control and caloric balance, accordingly. On the other hand, the human circadian rhythm is not governed only by the day/night cycle. There is data in the literature and scientific studies demonstrating that a proper circadian rhythm modulates the function of organs. The most studied model is that of the liver due to its function important in maintaining energy homeostasis, being aware that it is under day-to-day diurnal storage and energy use.<br>
BEST: temperature peak-level in mid-day! And min during mid-night!<br>
"cyclic glucocorticoid production with peak levels early in the morning, are also determined by the SCN" -&gt; this may be why if you wake up not in your phase you will feel out of your mind!<br>
-&gt; Avoid high-fat diet!!! Can be partially reversed, but not totally: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733</a><br>
There is a clear relationship between human dietary behaviour and circadian clockwork. The regular feeding-fasting cycles represent dominant synchronizing signals for peripheral clocks by initiating a series of molecular entrainment pathways, able to conduct the circadian routine. In contrast, disrupted feeding schedules can fully uncouple peripheral oscillators from the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, reinforcing the statement that metabolic cues, modulated by diet, reach and signal the SCN and modify specific output pathways of the clock [11, 29].<br>
. But some people reported that it worked for them: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/</a> so then to reduce health risks, use plant-based sources of fat, proteins and carbohydrates: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext" class="https">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/</a><br>
-&gt; BEST definition of entrainment: "The master clock within the brain is a functional high-fidelity receiver that reacts to ambient light–darkness signals, being the central element of the synchronization mechanisms. Nevertheless, each cell of the body has a self-circadian oscillator, regulated by a master clock that converges to conferring rhythm to every cell and organ compelling a complete functional system, through excitation of rate-limiting control measures of metabolic programs, in order to accomplish the circadian control of the entire organism. Essentially, metabolic control is not a regular circadian system output feature, but signal exerted by nutrients intake, energy turnover and the redox status represent precise feedback for cellular clocks. The circadian clock is intimately connected with the metabolic pattern, at all cellular organization and developmental levels, any insignificant misalignment in their communication channels efficiently deriving to a plethora of pathologies [44, 53]. Circadian clocks generate a high-fidelity inner projection of external temporal records by creating a cellular and whole organism dynamic environment that oscillates rhythmically at approximately 24 hours. Besides prompting daily rhythms, circadian clocks are sensors for environmental data that enable them to stay synchronized with day-night alterations, light and dark, hot and cold, as well as all the resources that rely on these modifications, primarily food convenience. Molecular oscillators generate 24-hour rhythmicity at the cellular level based on transcriptional-translation processes, metabolic feedback loops or their interaction. The temporal platform, which coordinates all functions to be performed at the right time within the 24-hour day, involves many interacting oscillators, all of which are part of the active synchronization process portrayed as entrainment [18, 52]. Any environmental factor that varies within the 24- hour day potentially can serve as an entraining signal, called zeitgeber. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a minuscule region of the brain in the hypothalamus, located directly above the optic chiasm, the dual function of circadian clocks as rhythm generators and sensors is particularly evident: it produces circadian rhythms in many of its cells, but also as a neuronal network it entrains these rhythms into the light-dark cycle through retinal feedback [23]. The SCN, often referred to as the primary pacemaker of the mammalian circadian system, serves predominantly as a relay station that transmits light and darkness data to additional oscillators present in the body by generating endogenous entrains, embodied at the molecular, physiological and behavioural level. As a central pacemaker, the SCN controls melatonin's pineal synthesis, but in the meantime, it reacts to melatonin itself, having regulatory potential on the core body temperature's daily rhythm."<br>

"A diurnal rhythm of eating-fasting promotes health, but the eating pattern of humans is rarely assessed. Using a mobile app, we monitored ingestion events in healthy adults with no shift-work for several days. Most subjects ate frequently and erratically throughout wakeful hours, and overnight fasting duration paralleled time in bed. There was a bias toward eating late, with an estimated &lt;25% of calories being consumed before noon and &gt;35% after 6 p.m. "Metabolic jetlag" resulting from weekday/weekend variation in eating pattern akin to travel across time zones was prevalent. The daily intake duration (95% interval) exceeded 14.75 hr for half of the cohort. When overweight individuals with &gt;14 hr eating duration ate for only 10-11 hr daily for 16 weeks assisted by a data visualization (raster plot of dietary intake pattern, "feedogram") that we developed, they reduced body weight, reported being energetic, and improved sleep. Benefits persisted for a year."

<li>BEST: melatonin affects POMC gene, serotonin activates MC4 receptors, and both melatonin and serotonin are interdependent! "The administration of exogenous melatonin in rats has been reported to induce the expression of the POMC gene in the ARC. [...] The rhythm of the activity of serotonin neurons is also shown as circadian changes, with a clear downward trend during the dark phase and an increase during the light phase. The changes were revealed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), hypothalamus and striatum; and these changes are likely the result of interactions between melatonin and serotonin. Anatomic proof of the existence of direct dependence between these two hormones is demonstrated through the proximity of their receptors in the DRN. The inhibitive impact of exogenous melatonin on the immunoreactivity of serotonin neurons in the DRN was observed, and the receptor of melatonin type 1 (MT1) acted as an agent in this effect.

<li><b>BEST: Caffeine blocks the effect of adenosine, which is the molecule behind the homeostatic sleep pressure process S.</b> So of course taking caffeine can impact the sleep since this and the circadian rhythm process C are inter-related!

<ul>
<li>This is exactly what interests individuals with CRSWDs: the impact of caffeine when they are sleep deprived and with a circadian misalignment</li>
<li>They did a forced desynchrony protocol of a 28h day</li>
<li>"Increased alertness by caffeine is associated with a higher core body temperature (CBT). A lower CBT and a narrow distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG) have been reported to be associated with improved sleep, yet whether caffeine influences the DPG is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the use caffeine during nighttime total sleep deprivation would reduce the DPG, increase CBT and alertness, and disturb subsequent daytime recovery sleep. We also expected that a greater widening of the DPG prior to sleep would be associated with a greater degree of sleep disturbance."</li>
<li>"Prior to sleep, caffeine significantly widened the DPG and increased CBT, alertness, and clear-headedness (p &lt; 0.05). Caffeine also disturbed daytime recovery sleep (p &lt; 0.05). Increased CBT and a wider DPG prior to sleep were associated with a longer latency to sleep, and a wider DPG was associated with disturbed recovery sleep (i.e., increased wakefulness after sleep onset, increased stage 1 sleep, decreased sleep efficiency, and decreased slow wave sleep) (p &lt; 0.05). A widening of the DPG following nighttime caffeine may represent a component of the integrated physiological response by which caffeine improves alertness and disturbs subsequent daytime recovery sleep. Furthermore, our findings highlight that sleep disturbances associated with caffeine consumed near the circadian trough of alertness are still present when daytime recovery sleep occurs 5 h or approximately 1 half-life later."</li>
<li>SUMMARY ME: caffeine increases body temperature, which makes it more difficult to fall asleep (increases likelihood of insomnia). Also it messes up with daytime recovery sleep at least up to 5h later (1 half-life later, so it can be 5 more hours until the complete effect of caffeine is removed - and that is without caffeine withdrawal symptoms!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Caffeine and withdrawal, to confirm: <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx" title="https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx" class="https">https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx</a>
<ul>
<li>" "Like withdrawal from any addictive substance, sleep will be affected by the increased autonomic response — jitteriness, nausea, increased heart rate, headaches, and irritability,” says Dr. Brodner, adding, “all completely opposite from the relaxed serenity required for good quality sleep.” As the body adjusts to less caffeine, these symptoms should subside. "</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST ME SUMMARY: I previously thought caffeine could help to artificially increase our vigilance instead of harder drugs such as modafinil. I still do, but it can mess up sleep recovery in particular when sleep deprived. So it's a double edged sword for us, and caffeine should certainly not be taken or tested as casually as typical sleepers do, crswd people should be more careful with caffeine. When you are sleep deprived, caffeine can be expected to provide a temporary boost by inhibiting adenosine binding to the receptors and hence a reduction in the homeostatic sleep pressure process S, but you can also expect caffeine to worsen the effects of sleep deprivation down the road, as it will even disturb later sleep recovery such as napping. So if you're sleep deprived, taking caffeine is the last thing you want to do (despite being what we usually do...). Note also caffeine works on adenosine, the homeostatic process S molecule, so that's why it increases vigilance and messes up with sleep.
<ul>
<li>BEST ME: This is why your sleep is chaotic, and why you shouldn't use sleeping pills nor caffeine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/</a></li>

&gt; The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore <b>use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.</b><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, <b>some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure</b>. Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, <b>a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.</b> These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
In other words, when trying to constraint to a socially normal schedule, it's normal that sleep times become more chaotic, with sometimes longer and sometimes shorter sleep, which makes it hard to see a nice N24 cycling pattern. Hence the importance of getting an opportunity to free-run without appointments nor alarm clocks.

For stimulants such as caffeine, this info can be combined with the following two sources:<br>
- Effects of Caffeine on Skin and Core Temperatures, Alertness, and Recovery Sleep During Circadian Misalignment - Andrew W. McHill, Benjamin J. Smith, Kenneth P. Wright, 2014 <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730414523078" title="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730414523078" class="https">https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0748730414523078</a><br>

</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Which shows that caffeine, although relieving some adenosine and hence some sleep pressure in the short term, worsen sleep deprivation down the line as it messes up with body temperature increasing the likelihood of insomnia and preventing later sleep recovery such as napping. In other words, for people with a CRSWDs and that are chronically sleep deprived, caffeine is the last thing you want to do to get better, it's only a temporary vigilance boost that you'll have to pay later with more sleep deprivation and more difficulty to recover from it.

"After eating -- particularly sugary foods -- insulin is produced by the pancreas which then converts these sugars (glucose), circulating in the bloodstream into glycogen within our cells," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"Excessive secretion of insulin causes the essential amino acid tryptophan to move into the brain. Once in the brain, it leads to increased production of serotonin and melatonin, which are two neurotransmitters that have a calming effect and help regulate sleep. Interestingly, around 90 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal movements."
</p>

<p>
Accredited practising dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon agrees, saying the amount of carbohydrates we eat at lunch can affect how sleepy we feel afterward.

"Carbohydrate containing foods such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes boost the production of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin, which can boost our mood but also make us feel content and possibly sleepy," O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia.
</p>

<p>
"It's often when we've eaten quite a large meal that we may feel uncomfortable and sluggish, as well, so it's always good to listen to our hunger signals and stop when we feel comfortably satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Another factor that may contribute to drowsiness after a meal is if you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance.
</p>

<p>
"Food allergies and intolerances are usually associated with digestive problems such as bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea, as well as lethargy," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"For example, you've probably heard or experienced that turkey can make you sleepier than other foods. Turkey and other high protein foods such as spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu and fish contain higher levels of tryptophan. Studies have shown that cherries (particularly sour cherry) affects melatonin levels, which is the hormone responsible for inducing sleep."
</p>

<p>
Another sleepiness inducing food is white bread, particularly when compared to whole grain, wholemeal or multigrain bread.
</p>

<p>
"When you consume white bread your body quickly absorbs the fibre-less starches and refined sugars rapidly, which causes a spike your blood glucose levels. This spike is short lived and results in plummeting blood glucose levels, which can lead to feelings of tiredness and sleepiness," Clark said.

<p>
An amino acid called tryptophan, which occurs in many protein-rich foods, helps the body produce serotonin. Carbohydrates help the body absorb tryptophan.<br>
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" title="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" class="https">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating</a>
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY: proteins increases levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which by itself makes us drowsy after lunch and additionally promotes secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Carbohydrates (glucides) help the body absorb tryptophan and thus secrete serotonin. So low-fat, high-carb, high-protein food increases serotonin naturally. Low-carb, low-protein, high-fat (ketogenic) diet on the other hand avoid serotonin secretion and thus can lead to improved energy levels (at the expense of mood?). -&gt; so if really difficult to stay on low-carb because of mood issues, try taking 5-HTP complement (but then probably reduced phase advance effects).
