<h3>Foreword</h3>

<br>

<p>
This is a draft of a potential article for a work-in-progress therapy to manage non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD). These procedures have not been vetted by the medical community nor reviewed by the scientific community.
</p>

<p>
Thus, it is NOT recommended to follow the therapeutic procedure outlined in "A new combined therapy", "Stage 1", "Stage 2" and "Preliminary results" sections, as they should be considered totally unreliable. At the time of this writing, this therapy produced little effect to improve the condition (another therapy not written here has provided significant effect, this draft will be updated in the future but for the moment it does not reflect the latest knowledge I have gotten from my partially working therapy).
</p>

<p>
However, the "Introduction" and "Current therapeutic approaches" section can be safely read and provide a review of the state-of-the-art knowledge on this and similar circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this document consists of unorganized notes and references, but you still may find them useful if you are interested in finding academic resources on various topics, just search for a specific term of interest (eg, if you are looking for the effect of the ketogenic diet on sleep and the circadian rhythm, search for "keto" which is a common shorthand for ketogenic).

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<br>

<p>
Sleep and circadian rhythm are highly conservated behaviors across all animals, and with some main components such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, also called "master clock", regulating sleep by light (photic) inputs, and having precedence over all other peripheral clocks (Aschoff 198?), such as the pituitary gland which secretes melatonin, or insulin secreted by the liver and temperature modulation in the intestines. These structures are present in all vertebrates[???], which shows they are highly conservated in evolution and are thus serving critical homeostatic functions. Although both of these functions are still under active research to understand them comprehensively, we know that circadian rhythm's purpose is to allow for a living organism to be in synchrony with its environment: to be awake when it's possible to seek food, and to sleep otherwise to recover for the next day. As such, all living organisms rely on these two crucial functions to support their activities. Any disruption, or any abnormal sleep pattern, can therefore only be rare and significantly disruptive as this would cause the living organism to fit less with its environment, and thus decrease its survival chances if we follow darwinian principles.
</p>

<p>
For humans, we know very well how much sleep is healthy depending on age, with diminishing length with increased age [<a href="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" title="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" class="https">https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png</a>]. If the sleep duration is quite well defined, the bed time and wake up time are more variable, with some people being "early birds" (or "morning larks"), others "night owls", and others in-between. These chronotypes can be detected by using questionnaires such as the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire[55].
</p>

<p>
Besides the social isolation and "laziness" stigmata that sleep and circadian rhythm disorders may be associated with — a persistent myth despite the fact that motivation, alertness and performance are directly influenced by sleep and circadian rhythms[56,58] —, they can lead to several health complications, nearly all stemming from acute or chronic sleep deprivation: from reduction of attention, memory and performance in work settings with only a single night of sleep deprivation, to brain grey matter atrophies and gene modifications[???], and increased risks of accidents[58, ??? hospital workers accidents]. These effects are observed not only during experimental sleep deprivation, but also in settings where there is time to sleep but the whole schedule is shifting in rotation, which represents 15% of all full-time workers in the United States in 2009[59], such as hospital night shift workers [???], firefighters[59], polar antartica expeditions[61], submariners[60] and the NASA Mars Pathfinder and Rover staff[57, 58]. Interestingly, in this latter case, the workers were tasked with following an unnatural 24.65h schedule, to follow martian day-night cycle. The authors report that in 2004, the veteran workers of the Pathfinder mission, described as highly motivated and dedicated to their work, decided in "a rebellion" to stop it <b>after only 1 month</b>, describing the schedule as "broken"[58]. Although the study authors could later setup a strategy to help the workers better synchronize their sleep-wake schedule on the Rover mission, they continued to report an increasing fatigue, hinting at a reduced sleep efficiency despite sleeping theoretically sufficient hours[58]. This goes to show the difficulty for any human being to follow a non natural sleep schedule, with chronic sleep deprivation effects becoming unbearable after only a month, even for highly trained and dedicated workers.
</p>

<p>
Non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD) is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (CRSWD) where the subject experiences a naturally and uncontrollably increasing shift in bed time and wake up time [44]. It can be diagnosed using various methods with different degrees of precision: from simple sleep logs where the patient simply writes the bedtime and wake up time, to polysomnographs, minimal temperature monitoring and salivary tests for dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).[44] It is also possible to use actimetry, as it was shown to be an accurate enough measurement method.[46]
</p>

<p>
(TODO: add prevalence, risks, genetics, etc on N24SWD or circadian rhythm disorders if not available)
</p>

<p>
Circadian rhythm disorders are complex, as they involve both internal clock mechanisms and external environmental cues ("zeitgebers", which influence on sleep was only relatively recently recognized since 1978[2]). In her landmark paper, De Coursey discovered the Phase Response Curve (PRC), a model of the complex interactions between the internal clock and external cues that was shown to be highly conservated across evolution, across all animal taxons[2]. This curve was first devised for the response to light, but is now also including melatonin, in what is now called a dark-light cycle[??]. This cycle can be succinctly summarized as follows: light stimulation close before sleeping delays the sleep onset (bedtime), whereas light after mid sleep advances sleep offset (wake up time). Melatonin does the opposite: administration close to bed time will advance sleep onset, whereas administration after mid sleep will delay sleep offset. Administration of light or melatonin at any other time during the wakeful phase has little to no effect on the PRC[19].
</p>

<p>
However, although the PRC shape and behavior is conservated in all animals, the exact timing will change between species: nocturnal animals will have their PRC's tau point (the central point of the PRC shape, from which the external cues effects are distributed around — this point is usually at about the mid-time of the sleep phase) during the day, since they sleep during the day, rather than at night. Furthermore, this can change between individuals: some will have their tau value early (the early birds), others later (night owls), and those afflicted with circadian rhythm might have it set during incomfortable times, or even an ever moving tau time for the non 24 free running disorder. The importance of the PRC for the sleep regulation cannot be overstated: it was found that the timing of light exposure relative to the PRC accounted for about 71% of the inter-individual variability of the PRC adaptation to night shift work, suggesting that although the PRC is only one of the sleep regulator mechanism — another one being the sleep homeostasis, regulating sleep pressure, as in Borbély's two-process model —, it is most likely the most important mechanism regulating the temporality/synchronicity with the zeitgebers of the circadian rhythm[25]. Furthermore, interactions between sleep homesteostasis and the PRC were experimentally observed, further supporting Borbély's model[11, 26, 41].
</p>

<p>
It is well known that humans, and nearly all animals, have a circadian phase length tau that is slightly beyond 24h, for humans it's about 24.2h according to NIH[1]. It was repeatedly demonstrated experimentally that isolating a human subject from any environmental cues (including light/dark cycle but also noise and thermal variations, food intake and exercise) causes a loss of entrainment to these external cues and ultimately a desynchronization from the 24h day cycle, causing the subject to revert back to its natural internal clock cycle beyond 24h[1, 2]. In other words, it can be said that humans are naturally non24. The problem lies when there is an impossibility to entrain properly (ie, to be synchronized to the target time) to these external cues, and thus to follow a 24h day cycle. In other words, although anybody can function on a bigger than 24h cycle in the absence of external cues, non 24h can only function in such a way, regardless of external cues. A corollary is that advancing cues (light around wake-up time) and pertinent elimination of delaying cues when necessary (absence of light/increase of melatonin before bedtime) are of paramount importance for any human to entrain to a 24h day cycle.
</p>

<p>
Another source of variability in the PRC shape resides in the magnitude of the response to external cues (ie, the height of the PRC). Not only the magnitude depends on the intensity/dosage of the zeitgeber[43], it also varies inter-individually because of endogenous factors[12]. Furthermore, the response to advancing or delaying cues is asymmetrical: on average, humans have been shown to have a range of entrainment (ROE) — which is the range of day time that one can maintain — to have been estimated between about 23h to 28h[2]. The magnitude is also asymmetrical, with low intensity light suppressing melatonin (and thus producing a delaying effect)[10, last ref], whereas high intensity light is required in the morning to advance the phase[43]. In other words, humans have a much easier possibility of delaying — and living on an extended day longer than 24h — than to advance by reducing their day duration. For instance, to make children sleep earlier than their usual time, it is advised to advance by small increments of 15 minutes[??]. This is also evidenced by the etiology of non-24 disorder, for which only cases of longer days than 24h are known (daily phase delay), and no case of individuals with a too short day (daily phase advance). Czeisler CA hypothesized that subjects with delayed sleep disorder (DSPD) may have an even weaker response to advancing the PRC phase, such that delaying was almost the only possible route. They furthermore tested their hypothesis experimentally on 5 DSPD subjects by devising a chronotherapy involving a tau of 27h for one week, in other words a daily 3h shift, which suggests that indeed DSPD subjects more easily responded to delaying than advancing, similarly to what was observed also in healthy volunteers without a circadian phase disorder (see below), although more studies with randomized trials with a bigger sample size are needed to confirm.
</p>

<p>
As written by [2]: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> <b>This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded.</b> Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that <b>90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route</b>. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance). »
</p>

<p>
Both the inter-individual variability of the PRC[12] and the hyper-sensitivity of DSPD and non-24 to delaying light cues[13] have now been observed experimentally, further supporting Czeisler et al's hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a third source of variability is that the PRC shape is centered around the tau point, the mid sleep time, which is equal to the day cycle duration. Combined with the asymmetry in the PRC shape, this might make an absolute (but not relative) advancing an impossible feat for subjects with circadian phase disorders. For example, if a human is on average able to advance 30 min daily, depending on their own tau, a person might be unable to effetively advance: if the tau is 24.2 (24h and 12 minutes), then the advancing capacity exceeds the natural free running induced by the internal clock ; but if another person has a tau of 25h, with the same advancing capacity, then the maximal advancing capacity is only of 24h30, which exceeds a 24h day schedule, meaning that even with proper response to external cues, this individual cannot entrain to a 24h day, but only to a 24h30 day. Thus, the tau and magnitude of an individual's PRC are mathematically critical parameters for this individual to be able to entrain to a 24h day cycle. And indeed, non 24 free running disorder (N24) and DSPD were both recently shown to have a delayed tau (mean phase duration)[3, 4], confirming one of Czeisler CA et al's hypotheses[2]. Footnote: In the 2016 study, it was found that DSPD had a tau of about 24.5h, whereas N24 had more than 25h. This would suggest that N24 might have as a defining characteristic a longer tau than other circadian rhythm disorders. However, this study had a very low sample size, particularly for N24 which was only of 2 subjects. Furthermore, the 2013 study on DSPD patients only found an average tau of 25h, thus eliminating the apparent (but non statistically significative) difference found in the 2016 study.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, DSPD were shown to have a delayed melatonin profile[18].

<p>
Thus, it is ALWAYS possible for a human to delay as well as advance, but advancing is always more limited compared to delaying. The corollary is that humans can modify their sleep onset/offset, simply by letting their natural clock free run.

<h5>Gut microbiota and melatonin</h5>

<p>
TODO: gut microbiota is the major producer of melatonin, melatonin is broken down by the liver, microbiota bacteria synchronized with melatonin (hence melatonin can help with irritable bowel syndrome?), melatonin helpful for liver diseases such as NASH, melatonin mixup with glucose, misregulation of melatonin due to melatonin receptor type 2 mutation and highly predictive of obesity and diabetes and other metabolic syndromes.
</p>

<h3>Current therapeutic approaches</h3>

<br>

<p>
Several treatments were proposed for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
The pituitary gland is an important component of the sleep-wake rhythm in humans. It was shown through lesional studies to regulate the circadian rhythm, and hence got the nickname of "master clock".[47] It is influenced by both light and melatonin.[47] In blind non 24 subjects, lesions in the pituitary gland have been regularly observed[??]. This led to the hypothesis that this disorder may be caused by dysfunctions in the master clock. Hence, the two most pursued treatments for non 24 so far have been by modulating these two antagonistic signaling pathways, melatonin, the "darkness hormone" which is secreted in the absence of light, and light, which inhibits melatonin secretion.
</p>

<p>
Melatonin has historically been the first line of treatment for non 24 in blind people. It was shown to be effective for entrainment in up to 67% of the subjects.[45] However, since this is a natural hormone that is not patentable, no pharmaceutical industrial went through the process of validating melatonin through national institutions such as the USA Food And Drugs Administration, and thus melatonin is not officially recognized as a treatment for non 24, although there is good evidence this is the case.[44, 45] There is currently only one recognized drug treatment for non 24, which is Tasimelteon (commercial name Hetlioz),[44] with an entrainment rate of 20% in a randomized controlled study, which seems considerably lower than melatonin's entrainment rate.[45] Apart from these two drugs, there is currently not enough evidence for any other kind of treatment or therapies for non 24, according to the 2015 guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).[44, 45] As pointed out by an excellent review, the AASM made their criteria more difficult in the latest revision of their guidelines, so that only treatments with reliably high confidence of effectiveness could be recommended, but that does not mean other therapies are ineffective, simply that there is not sufficient evidence.[45]
</p>

<p>
Light therapy was proposed as a way to advance the PRC. Increase in cognitive performance and attention was noted for night shift workers using a bright light (which definition of bright varies depending on the study) during their shift at night. However, light therapy has shown limitations: light cues have no effect on the circadian rhythm if outside of the PRC curves[19] (ie, only effect is around bedtime and wakeup time, during the individual's wake up period there is no effect), and furthermore sleep pressure can also reduce or nullify the effect of light[21]. Thus, it is important to both time correctly the light therapy according to the individual's PRC curve, and to ensure the individual is properly rested so that the light cue can be effectively processed to advance/delay the PRC.
</p>

<p>
An extension of the light therapy is the corollary dark therapy, which is to ensure that delaying light cues are minimized. Such a dark therapy usually involves either placing the individual in a dark room in the laboratory setting, as is often done to measure the natural DLMO and minimal temperature in order to qualify the circadian rhythm parameters such as its duration tau. Outside of the laboratory setting, experiments attempted to use accessories to help shift workers better adapt to their schedule, with significant success. Blue blockers glasses were shown to be efficient in improving the sleep efficiency and circadian rhythm delaying for night shift workers, and are now formally recommended by health bodies.[20] Although historically most studies have studies either light therapy or dark therapy, their combinations seem nowadays only natural since their complex interactions, by compounding or nullifying, provide an excellent mean to adjust one's circadian rhythm as shown in night shift workers[41].
</p>

<p>
Some have argued that the difference in the circadian rhythm might reflect an adaptation to a different timezone, and thus that moving the individual to a proper timezone would correct the chronotype. However, this was not supported by experiments, where the light exposure and occupation were explaining all the differences in the individuals chronotypes with no to little effect of the timezone.[17]
</p>

<p>
Another approach is chronotherapy. A naive chronotherapy commonly devised by non24 involves building a high sleep pressure by prior sleep deprivation, allowing to sleep at the target bedtime even though it is not in phase with the endogenous circadian rhythm and thus would mostly prevent any attempt to sleep during this high wakefulness period, bar for the high sleep pressure. This strategy is also employed by night shift workers[38, 41]. Needless to say, such strategies have very deleterious effects, not only in the long term, but also in the short term[??].
</p>

<p>
There are however more elaborate chronotherapy schemes that do not involve or limit sleep deprivation. A study on 5 DSPS patients found that chronotherapy was very effective to resynchronize the circadian rhythm faster to the target time by allowing free-running and even furthering the free-running to a higher tau (eg, follow a 27h day schedule instead of the endogenous 24.5h)[2]. All these patients were able to maintain their desired sleep schedules for months or even years after the therapy[2]. Despite the promises shown by chronotherapy in DSPS patients, a few authors raised concerns about the risk of modifying the tau parameter under the effect of artificial extension during chronotherapy[7], which stopped investigations into chronotherapy for circadian rhythm disorders since then. For instance, a case study reported the case of a DSPD patient transitioning to N24 after self-initiated adaptations in his lifestyle to accustom with his DSPD disorder[??]. This led to some suboptimal adaptations, such as practicing sport in the evening/night, which is known to negatively affect sleep efficiency when done this close to sleep onset[??]. This led some authors to argue this resulted in a regularly applied extended delay, ultimately causing a transition from DSPD to N24. This interpretation is arguable, as the patient did not follow a formal and controlled chronotherapy, but rather attempted to adapt his own schedule to his DSPD condition. Thus, the causality might be inversed: instead of the extended delay causing a switch to N24, it could be that the delay was caused by the DSPD transitioning to a N24. Thus, it can be debated whether these adaptations were caused by the DSPD condition, and whether a more appropriate and controlled chronotherapy would have instead enhanced his condition instead.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, these criticisms raise a new concept that was seldom, if never, studied before: <b>the possibility to change the tau parameter (by reduction/advancing or by expansion/delaying) via a behavioral therapy. </b>This concept can be further extended to any zeitgeber based therapy, and the question be more generally reframed as following: is the effect of zeitgebers cumulative over time, or is it fixed relatively to the baseline circadian rhythm?<b> This is named the hypothesis of circadian plasticity, which is that zeitgebers can permanently affect the circadian period tau, beyond direct exposure</b>. In other words: would forcing oneself to live longer or shorter days than the innate internal clock eventually lead to the internal clock adjusting to the new daylength?
</p>

<p>
Depending on the existence of this cumulative zeitgebers effects on the circadian period tau, two very interesting scenarios are possible:<br>
<ul>
<li>Either zeitgebers do not have a cumulative effect (ie, the tau parameter cannot be permanently changed),
<ul>
<li>in which case chronotherapy and other zeitgebers are a safe way to move faster the sleep onset/offset and partially resynchronize with a desired schedule, thus increasing drastically the patient's quality of life by allowing some degree of control over the disorder. In practice, this would allow such an individual to reduce the timespan with a very incomfortable sleeping schedule by increasing the delaying step (eg, sleep 3 hours later than the day before, instead of the usual 1h for an individual with a 25h cycle, to "skip" dephased days faster) ; as well as increase the timespan in a desired sleeping schedule by advancing the PRC daily during this period (eg, sleep 30 minutes earlier everyday compared to the day before, such that an individual with an usual 25h cycle would live on a 24h30 cycle instead — dephasing only by 30 min daily instead of 1h, thus doubling the time spent in the range of the desired sleeping schedule).</li>
<li>but then zeitgebers only have a fixed maximal capacity of phase delay/advance, which means that extreme cases of N24 or DSPD can likely not sufficiently phase advance to reach their ideal sleeping time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Either there is a cumulative effect, and hence the tau parameter can be changed, in which case:
<ul>
<li>delay chronotherapy might worsen circadian rhythm disorders such as DSPD into N24, as delaying might progressively extend the tau parameter and thus worsen the condition[2,35], studies showing that bigger taus are associated with worsened quality of life in circadian rhythm disorders [??]. But such adverse effects would also be reversible, perhaps at the cost of more stringent and uncomfortable sleep controlling measures, but still they would be reversible.</li>
<li><b>and more importantly, advance chronotherapy might be a potential curative treatment for circadian rhythm disorders</b>: although arduous since the range of entrainment and effect for advancing is more limited in humans (max 1h, but usually much less), daily advance in the PRC would eventually result in advancing the tau parameter to the desired value, closer to 24h. This would be the only mechanism known to durably reduce the circadian rhythm cycle.</li>
<li>The population that might suffer from non24 might be much wider than previously thought, as non24 may be behaviorally caused in this scenario. Indeed, if the tau parameter can be behaviorally or chemically changed, combined with the well-known fact that human's circadian rhythm is naturally above 24h and thus free-running, this would suggest that anybody could potentially acquire the non24 syndrome under specific conditions. Contrarywise, previous studies on variable night shift work found that some chronotypes, mostly the early birds, have more difficulties adjusting to changes in their sleep schedule[15, 27, 38]. A few studies on the NASA personnel explored the possibility to enforce a non24-like free-running schedule of 24.65 hours for 78 days, in order to assess the potential impact of future human cosmonauts who would go on a mission to Mars. These studies found that most of the personnel had major difficulties adjusting to this new schedule, with inefficient sleep even past the 78 days. Other studies simulating the adaptation to a martian days of 24.65 hours interestingly found that some participants could adapt to a non-24 hours day schedule, whereas others could not[65]. These studies however did not assess the initial chronotype of the participants[22, 23]. Indeed, it's known that the early bird chronotype might be partially determined genetically[63]. All of these preliminary evidences combined suggest that, in the case that the tau parameter is modifiable behaviorally or chemically, genetic mutations and predispositions are probably another contributing or discontributing factor to acquire non24. <b>The early bird genotype might be a barrier preventing free-running and proper synchronization to zeitgebers, much like a genotype of zeitgebers hypersensitivity would on the contrary facilitate non24 acquisition by essentially making these subjects more susceptible to environmental factors</b>[12, 13, 25, 28]. Furthermore, other genotypes may innately produce an increased tau, just as much as, in this hypothesis, behavioral adaptations might also delay the tau enough for entrainment to a 24h cycle being outside of the ROE[32]. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to modify the genotype by inducing genetic mutations[65, ??], hence specific lifestyles might induce genetic mutations causing or worsening circadian rhythm disorders such as non24. Thus, it is conceivable that there is a two-way interaction between genetic mutations and behavior/lifestyle, both influencing each other. And actually, these complex interactions between environmental and endogenous factors have already been suggested to explain the difficulties in adaptation of night shift workers[15, 41]. Further studies on these interactions might yield extraordinary insights into the physiopathology of circadian rhythm disorders.</li>

<p>
Despite the focus of most studies on the master clock, there is evidence that the sleep-wake rhythm is dictated not only by the master clock but by several pathways in the peripheral nervous system (ie, in the whole body).[47, 48, 49, 50] Indeed, there are several evidences of the implication of mistimed food intake impacting the circadian rhythm[51], which can in turn influence insulin sensitivity[52], and even the composition of the diet can cause disruptions in the circadian rhythm[53]. This can have dire consequences, as mistimed sleep, without direct sleep deprivation, can increase the risk for various metabolic diseases such as diabetes and even alter the human transcriptome. (TODO: extend and add refs, process refs in [54]).
</p>

<h3>A new combined therapy</h3>

<br>

<p>
Leveraging the natural tendency of humans to delay more easily, we here propose a new combined therapeutic strategy, aiming to at least enhance the individual's quality of life by teaching how to exert more control on the sleep schedule, while minimizing or avoiding altogether sleep deprivation, which can have lasting effects from the very first night of sleep deprivation[??]. This strategy involves both a chronotherapy to allow the subjects to learn how to exert some control on their internal clock, as well as ... therapy (luminotherapy, dark therapy, sound therapy?) to control external cues as needed, as well as self reporting using computerized tools to help the user both track and also follow through the whole process.
</p>

<p>
This strategy allows to test the two hypotheses of the tau adaptation, and get benefits in either cases: at worst, if the tau parameter cannot be changed, the strategy allows the individuals to exert more control on their PRC and thus sleep phases and quality of life via an individually adapted chronotherapy and sleep hygiene ; at best, it allows to reduce or might even eliminate the circadian rhythm disorder by progressively reducing the tau parameter until it gets closer to 24h to allow entrainment.
</p>

<p>
The strategy involves two stages:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>control of internal clock by extending/delaying the PRC (chronotherapy) + elimination/reduction of potentially influencing external cues → see chronotherapy below.</li>
<li>stabilizing the internal clock by avoiding extension/delaying of the PRC + restoration/simulation of external cues as needed to complement the target PRC</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Such a combined therapy was suggested as a very promising approach to investigate[2, 15], however it was never done before to this extent and data is lacking.
</p>

<p>
All the calculations below will use the wake up time as the reference point to estimate the DLMO and the circadian rhythm of the individuals, which was found to be an accurate proxy for the DLMO for both typical sleepers and individuals with DSPD, contrary to the bedtime which was not predictive of the DLMO in either[6, 14]. Furthermore, we will not follow current recommendations of various health organizations about the timing of melatonin administration, as they were shown to be ineffective, but rather use the latest evidence from research experiments:
</p>

<p>
«Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.»[16]
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, moving the participant's sleep schedule directly to the target sleep schedule at once has been shown to be not only ineffective, but also harmful by causing sleep deprivation. In effect, although the participant might forcefully wake up at the required time by using a device like an alarm clock, the circadian rhythm will behind the walls slowly drift in a free-running fashion until attaining the target time, meanwhile the desynchrony between the sleep schedule and the internal circadian rhythm decreasing the sleep efficiency as evidenced by polysomnography and ultimately sleep deprivation, as observed in both normal sleepers and non24 patients[2 with footnote 36 and footnote 37].
</p>

<p>
TODO: justify using literature on dsps and night shift work disorder: sighted non24 is very rare or misdiagnosed so litterature sparse, it is arguable whether all circadian rhythm disorders have shared mechanisms, with hints indicating that's true because melatonin work for all and sleep is a very conservated mechanism so likely it's a very stable process throughout evolution with some inter species and inter individual variability.
</p>

<h4>Stage 1</h4>

<br>

<p>
Before starting the Stage 1 of this protocol, it is crucial for the participant to both get diagnosed properly by a specialist physician in circadian rhythm disorders, and to rest properly for at least 2 weeks by following his/her own sleep schedule. The latter might not be as easy as it sounds: chronic sleep deprivation causes a decrease in cognitive performance that is not perceived properly by the subject, which means that subjects that are sleep deprived, which is a common occurrence for persons with the non24 syndrome, will have more difficulties to know when they need to sleep and how  to adapt their behavior to help inducing sleep (which is a big part of the Stage 1 process).[24, 29, 31] Hence, a period of stabilization in the sleep schedule (in the sense that the natural free-running sleep schedule is following to the participant's needs) is essential for the proposed therapy to have any efficiency. This "pre-protocol" period can be advantageously used to order the necessary equipment as well as put in place good practices such as systematically maintaining a sleep log with the help of applications such as Sleepmeter (more about that below). Also, participants should be cautioned that they may be left in a worse condition if they do not follow through the whole protocol (stages 1 and 2).
</p>

<p>
time management is crucial, but more difficult even for night shift workers: «It is common to feel like there is too much to do and not enough time, especially when working the night shift. Prioritize your sleep by blocking off that time first, then determine what else must get done, assign a time for those activities, and delegate or postpone other tasks. We do not routinely decide to pull all-nighters when working days; working nights is not the time for it either. Sleep should not be an afterthought.» <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a>
</p>

<p>
Stage 1: Delaying phase chronotherapy to reach the target wake up time: The chronotherapy involves an alternating strategy on 2 days, for 8 days:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>delay on day 1: extend the sleep onset by 3 hours (ie, sleep 3 hours later than the usual, or can calculate 4h subtracted from the sleep offset/wake up time if this one is more stable). Sleep as much as optimally needed to feel rested (X hours), and wake up at the new wake up time W. Eg: usual sleep time is from 5am to 1pm, on day 1 the new sleep time will be from 8am to 4pm (optimal sleep time of 8h), but the individual wakes up at 3pm instead (and sleeps less than the optimal 8 hours).</li>
<li>stabilize on day 2: sleep at W-X=O time until W time. Eg: the individual will sleep from 7am to 3pm, effectively having delayed by 2h.</li>
<li>Adjust and repeat for all subsequent days, and write down the time in a sleep log after each day. Adjusting consists in reducing/extending the delay depending on sleep efficiency:
<ul>
<li>if take time to sleep then too early, O time should be delayed.</li>
<li>if having too many nightmares (indicating more REM sleep than non-REM sleep), or wake up too early, then slept too late. O time should be advanced.</li>
<li>Hint: the temperature minimum is attained at the mid sleep time, thus when the individual is feeling colder, this might be a good hint that the PRC shape has begun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop this stage when the individual reaches a wake up time close to the target wake up time, with enough margin to account for a few days of continued delays. For this experiment, we advised 4 days of margin. Eg, if the individual's tau before the stage 1 was 24.5h, thus 30min delay each day, and the target wake up time was 9.00am, the stage 1 should stop when the individual wakes up at 7.00am, to allow for 4 days of delaying before reaching 9.00am. During this period, stage 2 will be started in order to attempt to maintain the individual's circadian rhythm in this phase. The number of days of margin can be adjusted depending on the amount of margin one wants to leave in order to adjust to stage 2.</li>
</ol>
</p>

FIGURE 3: summarizing stage 1
</p>

<p>
During the application of the chronotherapy, it is essential to control a maximum of external parameters:<br>
<ul>
<li>At wake-up:
<ul>
<li>turn on bright lights (use a neon of white light — not yellow — for extended time and/or use luminotherapy lights for short time just after waking up)</li>
<li>Can take melatonin supplement to help delay further (although the effect might be paradoxical — it may not delay but advance, the effect of melatonin might be desynchronized compared to light in circadian rhythm disorders, this is a hypothesis advanced by some authors and there is currently no evidence in favor or against it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before (1-2h at least) bedtime:
<ul>
<li>use blue and green light blockers glasses 2h before the planned sleeping time (such as Uvex Skypper S1933X or Uvex S0360X Ultra-spec 2000 [8] — it is also possible to precisely measure the light stimulation by using a spectrometer or new consumer-grade devices such as the Lys[9]).</li>
<li>stay in a place with minimum to no light intensity. Even with blue and green light blockers, the light intensity can still impact the circadian rhythm. Indeed, it was shown that even lux as small as 2-3 (candle lit dinner) suppress melatonin production [10].</li>
<li>avoid using electronic screens (except ebook readers with einks and no backlight). If really needed, set the backlight to the minimum, and use apps to turn the colors red, such as Twilight on Android. Any screen filter software that does not totally turn all colors to reddish is not filtering enough.</li>
<li>use an eye night cap to block a maximum of light during sleeping</li>
<li>go out of bed and do not go to the bed until it's the planned time to sleep (avoid working from bed! If you can't sleep, go out of your bed and come back half an hour later)</li>
<li>use noise blocking ear plugs during sleeping</li>
<li>turn off any sound or vibration notifications from phones and such</li>
<li>avoid practicing sport before bedtime, prefer to practice after waking up, during the first part of the (relative) day.</li>
<li>eat early at least 3h before bedtime, including beverages like coffee[30] or sugar drinks.</li>
<li>Other advices can be found in: <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The maximum efficiency of this chronotherapy is a delay of 12h under 7 days (the 8th being for the final stabilization, which then should be followed by the strategy's stage 2, which is simply the continuation of this stabilization).
</p>

<p>
However, this efficiency can only be reached if the subject's internal clock can be entrained to a 27h day. DSPD patients were shown to be able to partially entrain[2], however, they did not fully entrain as shown by the reduced sleep efficiency in one of their subject towards the end of the chronotherapy delaying phase they used. In such a misentrainment case, the internal clock will revert to its natural tau[2] (eg, 24.2h in humans on average, for non-24 the delay can be longer from 0.5 to 1h30/day usually), thus a delay will still occur but reduced, which will in practice result in a reduced sleep duration, less efficient sleep and interruptions in the sleep (eg, waking up earlier than intended)[2]. However, when inducing an increased delay shifting, the free-running circadian rhythm might be bigger than the endogenous free-running rhythm without induction. For instance, in night shift workers, who were otherwise normal sleepers and thus probably with an average tau around 24.2h, it was observed that on average the circadian rhythm shift was about 1h, which would be a tau of 25h[41]. Our strategy tries to reduce this issue by allowing an alternating day of stabilization, whereas [2] chained the delays. It is also possible to adjust the number of delay hours by reducing it until the sleep efficiency is not impacted anymore.
</p>

<p>
Alternating days of delay and stabilization further provide a safeguard against the possibility of permanently extending the tau: by stabilizing, we try to ensure that the internal clock does not register the extension of tau as permanent but only as transient, as this was one of the raised concern about chronotherapies in circadian rhythm disorders[7].
</p>

<p>
For writing the time in a sleep log, we advise to use Sleepmeter Free combined with the Sleepmeter Widget by Squall Line Software[5], which are free tools on smartphones that simplifies the maintenance of a sleep log, with the additional benefit of being very precise: instead of writing the time at which you retrospectively think you went to sleep and woke up, the subject can simply tap a widget on the screen when going to sleep and when waking up. The software will then delimit the sleep times, with optionally a calculation of some offset time (eg, if the subject is a slow sleeper and takes 30 min before sleeping, or is drowsy in the morning and takes 20 min to wake up, it is possible to set up the software to automatically add or subtract such amount of time automatically from the "widget tap" times). Using such a software will allow the subject to both more precisely track its own sleep duration, timing and quality, but also provide an incentive for continuing the therapy (increasing therapy compliance). This can furthermore provide valuable data to the physicians and researchers, as sleep log data was shown to be highly predictive of the PRC, allowing to model it with 90% accuracy from sleep logs alone[6]. The digitalization of sleep logs also show great promise to allow for large-scale sleep data acquisition for scientific studies, as well as provide automated health guidance for the individual[62].
</p>

<p>
Napping was suggested to be advised to help in adaptation to zeitgebers by reducing sleep pressure and increase clock susceptibility to light[11], however this was not experimentally tested and there is evidence that napping reduces the sleep pressure and sleep duration during the bedtime sleep, making it more difficult by reducing sleep efficiency because of a lack of sleep pressure and slight sleep debt, which would otherwise ease falling asleep at the planned time[26, 39]. Also napping does not allow to cycle through all sleep stages in the same way that a full night of sleep does[40]. Furthermore, DSPS were found to have slower sleep pressure buildup compared to normal sleepers, and one can probably safely assume the same holds true for non24[15]. We thus disadvise napping in this phase unless required because of too much sleep deprivation (eg, because of a daily shift too big, in which case it should be reduced to allow for easier entrainment).
</p>

<p>
In any case, shifting might produce a more chaotic sleep schedule, as the forced behaviorally-induced shifting might not always be followed by a concrete shift in the circadian rhythm depending on various factors[33]. The participant should thus be prepared that this stage 1 might not be followed by a daily result, but should not be detracted from the overall result that the induced shifting produces (ie, the shifting should in the end be overall faster and allow the reaching of the target wake up time faster than by following the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm). In the worst case scenario, the participant will simply shift according to the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm, but at best, and with the help of environmental cues control such as light, the shift will be faster when following this protocol.

</p>

<h4>Stage 2</h4>

<br>

<p>
Stage 2: environmental cues control and melatonin administration to advance phase<br>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B12 cyanocobalamin 1000mcg once per day, everyday (eg, Solgar brand). Vitamin B12 was shown to resolve a few sighted non24 cases and allow entrainment to a 24h schedule[55]. More recent studies evidenced a potential mechanism for this effect, with the B12 potentiating the magnitude of zeitgebers effects on the PRC (ie, B12 allows both light and melatonin — whether endogenous or exogenous — to have more shifting effect — whether advancing or delaying — on the circadian rhythm)[34].</li>
<li>For melatonin administration: use 1 pill <b>every few days (not everyday)</b> of <b>instant release</b> melatonin, dosed at 1.9mg. Instant release is VERY important. More details:
<ul>
<li>The optimal time to take the medication should be at the DLMO point - 4 hours[15]. To calculate the DLMO point = (wake up time - optimal sleep duration - 2.5) mod 24 [14].  We subtract 2.5 as it is the average between the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2009-2590" title="Lewy's PRC finding an average DLMO 2h before bedtime and more recent studies finding 3h before bedtime, but with the caveat that DLMO-to-bedtime is highly variable, with 60% of the individuals having more or less than 2-3h" class="https">Lewy's PRC finding an average DLMO 2h before bedtime and more recent studies finding 3h before bedtime, but with the caveat that DLMO-to-bedtime is highly variable, with 60% of the individuals having more or less than 2-3h</a>. Eg, if wake up time is 9am and the optimal sleep duration is 8 hours, the DLMO point will be at 9-8-2.5 = 10pm. From there, the optimal melatonin administration would be at 11-4 = 6pm. In practice, the melatonin should be taken between the optimal melatonin point and the DLMO, thus between 6pm and 10pm in our example, but NOT before 6pm, as then the melatonin would have little to no effect before this point in the PRC phase.</li>
<li>Note that the bedtime, and DLMO, should not be calculated according to the target bedtime the subject would like, but rather, as suggested in previous reviews, according to the usual/expected bedtime if the subject follows the endogenous freerunning rhythm. The idea is to use melatonin as a tau shortener, in other words to advance the bedtime, and thus it should be adapted to the actual bedtime and not the wished one.</li>
<li>In this protocol, the melatonin administration is NOT daily, but every few days as required: when the individual uses melatonin at the optimal point (or close after), the PRC will be advanced. There is no currently available model that can predict the amount of advance that will thus be effected to any individual, but it can amount to less than a hour to several hours. Thus, the individual should take the melatonin when required to stay in a "range of target times": if for example the target time is to be awake by 9am, and the melatonin advance the PRC by 2h with a single dose, then the individual can take the melatonin when the wake up time gets close to 9am, to shift back to 7am, and then refrain from melatonin administration for a few days until the individual's circadian rhythm gets gradually close to 9am again. This way, the individual will always wake up between 7am and 9am, by using melatonin administration only when necessary. We also suggest this might also have the beneficial side consequence of avoiding habituation lessening effects that might happen with continuous administration of melatonin. If done properly, the wake up time should be irrespective of the bed time, although the individual should feel more sleepy earlier than the days prior, following melatonin administration.</li>
<li>TOADD (rewrite): about the dosage, melatonin was shown to work for some individuals with as little as 0.5mg</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
or even 0.05mg I think<br>
it's mentioned in the current AASM guidelines, and before I have read the original paper<br>
so this suggests that the dosage does not matter<br>
I used to take 5mg at  first, then 3mg, now I use 1 or 1.5mg and it works just the same<br>
nowadays I just use whatever is commercially available<br>
the only thing you want to make sure is to use an instant release melatonin<br>
not a "long release"<br>
because you want it to trigger your sleep mode<br>
yes I did not know that for a long time, it was my physician who told me and now that I did a more thorough review of the scientific literature and what is known about sleep and circadian rhythm, it makes perfect sense<br>
if you take a long release melatonin, it won't help much to go to sleep at the time you want, and in the morning you will feel more sleepy, because the melatonin will still be in effect<br>
long release melatonin is for those who take it as a relaxant<br>
(and I used both before knowing about the difference, and I can confirm, the long release ones do not work for us)

<li>stick to your sleeping schedule: be rigorous with your sleeping schedule and hygiene: remember it is likely you have more sensitivity to delaying effects, thus you should be particularly careful to avoid anything that can delay your sleep (eg, evening/night time social events). Note however that social contacts and knowledge of clock time were found insufficient for entrainment, so although these can disrupt the sleeping efficiency, they are not sufficient to stick to a sleeping schedule[60].</li>
<li>avoid watching moving images (ie, videos) before sleep, prefer reading on an e-ink ebook or at worst a smartphone screen with a reddish screen filter and minimal backlight (ie, Twilight app on Android). Avoid using a laptop screen. Indeed, laptop screens tend to backlight more lux (ie, to project more light) compared to a smartphone, because a smartphone's screen is smaller and also for energy economy reasons they tend to allow a lower amount of intensity at the minimal setting than do laptop screens.</li>

<li>RECORD your sleep log with sleepmeter, including inputing when you used an accessory (night cap, blue blocker, etc)</li>
<li>Optional: expose yourself to bright light (lux &gt;= 3000) in the 4 hours following wake-up to induce more phase advance[43]. If your wake up time is during the day, you can expose yourself to sunlight (even if cloudy), but if not an artificial light with the appropriate lux intensity can be used. Note that most artificial lights can only project enough lux for phase advance at very close range. New devices such as the Luminettes are currently investigated to make the use of such artificial light therapy more comfortable and increase the rate of treatment compliance.</li>

<h3>Preliminary results</h3>

<br>

<p>
This section describes work-in-progress results that have not been statistically tested, they are <b>first-hand observations</b> on a <b>single case</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone-based sleeping log solutions may provide a quite accurate ground to predict phase shifts (and thus may help the subject in planning the next weeks or months of sleep schedules).</li>
<li>Accessories (sleep eye mask, ear plugs, blue blockers and blue light filters apps) seem to improve sleep efficiency (TODO: statistical test on difference in sleep length as a proxy for efficiency, else would need an actimeter or polysomnograph with and without).</li>
<li>Time-restricted feeding (skipping evening meal) may increase perceived tiredness at natural time to sleep (which in turns contributes to sleep efficiency). It may also somewhat reduce the phase shift.</li>
<li>Melatonin between 5 and 3 hours before calculated optimal bedtime (bedtime = 8 hours before last wakeup time) seems to have a similar, but stronger effect (to potentiate sensitivity to natural tiredness). It seems to phase advance bedtime, but not wakeup time (ie, the subject sleeps longer, but without any benefit, except as a "sleeping pill" when necessary).</li>
<li>Stage 1 procedure seems to indeed help in cycling faster. But stage 2 does not seem to stabilize.</li>

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>

It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells.

[36]: BEST: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>

This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities.

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>
Also ref for sleep pressure = homeostatic regulation of sleep: «Moreover, loss of sleep is followed by increased sleep indicating some kind of homeostatic regulation of sleep.»<br>

Sleep pressure concept from experiment: Dijk and Czeisler,1995 - but poorly understood, lacking data.<br>
Sleep debt stems from Borbely's work, or more precisely a homeostatic debt initially termed.<br>
Essentially, Borbely's model is that there are two sleep phases: the circadian sleep phase, modelled by the PRC, and the homeostatic sleep phase. The interaction of both is modelled by Borbely's. But the homeostatic sleep phase is poorly understood, apart from the fact that sleep deprivation, in other words a higher sleep pressure, leads to a lowered response to light. Thus, the sleep depriving strategy to resynchronize is not appropriate, and even reduces the chances in succeeding a delay shift.

There are thus lots of complex interactions in various processes pertaining to sleep, it is not simply a single process. Hence, there are lots of parameters, which interactions and effects are not entirely elucidated to this day, but we have already good evidence to think that they are useful for sleep regulation and potentially control.

«Approximately 10% of patients with chronic insomnia are reported to have DSWPD, suggesting the requirement of strict diagnostic criteria to differentiate DSWPD from sleep onset insomnia.»<br>

Figure 2: «In an individual with DSWPD (B), DLMO occurs later than in a normal sleeper (A) and is potentially influenced by hypersensitivity to evening light, increased evening light exposure, and decreased morning light exposure. A delay in the phase of the circadian pacemaker and sleep-wake timing has been reported in patients with DSWPD, manifesting as a longer interval between CBTmin and sleep offset time, compared with normal sleepers (A). [...]  In healthy sleepers, the temperature minimum during sleep occurs w2 hours before sleep offset, whereas in DSWPD the temperature minimum has been reported to occur w4 hours before sleep offset.»<br>
BEST: DSPD have slower homeostatic sleep pressure buildup, they feel less. «Based on this association, dysregulation of the homeostatic sleep process may be an underlying mechanism that contributes to later sleep onset times in patients with DSWPD. As shown by Uchiyama and colleagues,56,57 sleep propensity during wake differs between patients with DSWPD and controls following sleep restriction, with patients with DSWPD accumulating homeostatic sleep drive at a slower rate compared with controls. In combination with slower homeostatic sleep drive accumulation, it has also been theorized that DSWPD symptoms may be influenced by slower dissipation of sleep pressure. Studies have reported that patients with DSWPD have longer habitual total sleep times compared with normal sleepers.»<br>

«Individuals with DSWPD who have more delayed sleep and a greater phase angle also have more irregular sleep. This suggests that it is not delayed sleep timing per se that drives poor functional outcomes in DSWPD, but rather the timing of sleep relative to circadian phase and resultant irregular sleep patterns.», Sleep regularity is associated with sleep-wake and circadian timing, and mediates daytime function in Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132578" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132578" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31132578</a><br>

<li>Melatonin:</li>

Melatonin phase-shifts human circadian rhythms with no evidence of changes in the duration of endogenous melatonin secretion or the 24-hour production of reproductive hormones. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970302" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970302" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12970302</a><br>
Melatonin advances the circadian timing of EEG sleep and directly facilitates sleep without altering its duration in extended sleep opportunities in humans. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15459246</a><br>
<b>BEST: melatonin optimal administration timing: «4 hours before DLMO induces a maximal phase advance</b> (Fig. 3C), whereas melatonin administration 12 to 15 hours after DLMO or up to 4 hours after waking is reported to induce maximal phase delays.80 A meta-analysis conducted in 2010 by Geijlswijk and colleagues81 investigating the efficacy of melatonin for DSWPD indicated that, compared with placebo, melatonin treatment advances endogenous melatonin onset by, on average, 1.18 hours, decreases SOL by 23 minutes, and advances sleep onset by 0.67 hours. Although this meta-analysis did not take dosage of melatonin into consideration, others have shown that a small dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg is as effective as 3 mg for advancing sleep onset.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884</a><br>
BEST: «Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.» <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" class="https">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135</a><br>
BEST: dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) predicted by wake time and midpoint of sleep, but not bedtime. ME: so wake time (sleep offset) better to predict real bedtime and circadian rhythm than bedtime (sleep onset). <b>«The DLMO occurred about 2 hours before bedtime and 14 hours after wake. Wake time and midpoint of sleep were significantly associated with the DLMO (r = 0.77, r = 0.68 respectively), but bedtime was not (r = 0.36). The possibility of predicting young healthy normally entrained people's DLMOs from their sleep times is discussed.»</b>, The relationship between the dim light melatonin onset and sleep on a regular schedule in young healthy adults., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132</a><br>
<b>NOTE ME: all these parameters can be assumed to be on adults with an average sleeping duration of 8h (hence 14h after wake up = 2h before bedtime). Thus melatonin should be administered 4+2h = 6h before bedtime! Totally different from what is prescribed! But more precise calculation since wake up time more predictive of dlmo would be: time of optimal melatonin administration = (wakeuptime+(24-optimalsleepduration(8h?)-2)-4)mod(24)</b><br>

Summary: DLMO determination through objective measurements from saliva is better to do before treatment to optimize the treatment, but it's less adequate for n24 since it's constantly delaying.<br>
<b>BEST: melatonin levels normal for DSPD except 3h delay and diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion (maybe because of light hypersensitivity?)</b> «DSPD patients had significantly later timed melatonin profiles that were delayed by approximately 3 h compared to normal sleepers, and there were no notable differences in the relative duration of secretion between groups. However, melatonin secretion between dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and acrophase was less prominent in DSPD patients compared to good sleepers, who showed a more acute initial surge of melatonin following the DLMO. Although the regulatory role of melatonin is unknown, abnormal melatonin profiles have been linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease). These results therefore suggest that in addition to a delayed endogenous circadian rhythm, a diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion following DLMO may contribute to the etiology of DSPD.», Nocturnal Melatonin Profiles in Patients with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder and Control Sleepers., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168</a><br>
BEST: «DSWPD patients exhibited 31.5% greater phase delay shifts than healthy controls. In both groups, a later initial melatonin phase was associated with a greater magnitude phase shift», Increased sensitivity of the circadian system to light in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150</a><br>
→ BEST ME: Thus DSPD are more sensitivy to light phase delay shifts (31.5%!), less to melatonin surge secretion, and have slower sleep buildup (maybe due to less melatonin secretion) compared to normal sleepers. Also maybe why strong melatonin with immediate release is better, do not take long release melatonin (useless since duration is not different between controls and dspd). Since the PRC can be asymmetrical, the higher sensitivity to phase delay light (ie, closer to bedtime) gives no indication about light phase advance sensitivity, which might be lower than for good sleepers.<br>

The improvement during WMZ was most prominent after extended wakefulness (i.e., day 2 of the CR).» → ME: might be why n24 have so much difficulty sleeping, the only time when they feel at their performance peak is just before they need to sleep, and since sleep pressure builds up more slowly, might be more difficult to sleep (eg, stop working when in the "zone"). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585751" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585751" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23585751</a><br>

Although studies in adolescents with subclinical DSWPD75 and case reports have shown positive results,42 there are currently no published controlled trials that have shown efficacy for this treatment approach.76 Findings from one study indicate that prescribed sleep scheduling is associated with high relapse rates,77 whereas another reports the development of free-running CRSWDs in a patient with DSWPD after the sleep scheduling intervention.7"</li>

Low-fat (carb diet) does not help (although it helps with weight loss), I tested for more than a year. Intermittent fasting neither although it helps a bit to nudge forward or backward (not really backward but slow the shift a bit).<br>
Good recent lay public article, keto (low-carb) can help with insulin management, for diabetics and obese (several studies!): <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" class="https">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html</a><br>
If keto works, hypothesis is either that insulin signaling has more impact on circadian rhythm than previously thought, with some people such as non24 being particularly sensitive, maybe in particular it's pre-diabetic non24 people that are more sensitive? Or it can be because of gut dysbiosis, maybe candida albicans overgrowth that is stunted after some weeks of ketosis?<br>
Beware, very low carb may starve bacteria and in fact promote candida albicans overgrowth, because candida albicans has a mitochondria and thus can feed off from ketones, so better to have low carb (not very low)? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/</a> and <a href="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" title="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" class="https">https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/</a> - also this last link explains why too low carb will diminish/disable the immunity system, so actually it's very bad overall ,plus there is no evidence that apart in immunodepressive people, candida albicans can cause any chronic subtle issues (chronic candidiasis, or candida hypersensitivity), it's only proven to cause big issues and only in immunodepressed individuals, so if keto works for some non24, it's likely not because of "starving" candida albicans contrary to what alternative medicine proponents may claim: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" title="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" class="https">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/</a><br>

"It’s crucial, doctors say, to consult with a dietitian or physician, have cholesterol levels regularly checked, and replenish the fluids and sodium lost by increased urination and the severe restriction of carbohydrates. If not, within two to four days of beginning the diet, that depletion can bring on the “keto flu” — symptoms like dizziness, poor sleep and fatigue in some people." “Carbohydrates have a lot of nutrients that can help us maintain our body function,” said Dr. Prado. On the diet, some people experience “keto breath,” a halitosis likely caused by the production of acetone, which is one of the ketone bodies.<br>

<li>"This study demonstrates how a ketogenic diet strongly and specifically influences the endogenous clock and the circadian physiology of two different peripheral tissues: liver and intestine. Sleep-wake cycle, changes in body temperature, and hormone blood levels are just few daily patterns governed by the endogenous clock. Circadian (from the Latin “circa” = around, and “die” = day) rhythms are involved in sustaining important biological processes and their alteration, such as during shift-work or frequent transoceanic flights, can drastically perturb our physiology and health. Virtually, all the tissues of our body contain an internal clock, which synchronizes the specific tissue physiology to stimuli coming from the external world. Metabolic homeostasis and circadian clock functions are profoundly linked. <b>Time of food and its composition, such as a western high fat diet, has been shown to affect the liver endogenous clock, impinging on its circadian rhythmicity both transcriptionally and metabolically.</b> However, little is known about how the intestinal clock is affected by food and how different peripheral clocks specifically interpret a nutritional stress. [...] <b>Genome-wide analysis showed that PPAR-alpha target genes displayed a specific daily rhythmicity in the intestine upon ketogenic diet. Intriguingly, beta-hydroxyl-butyrate, an important metabolite produced by the activation of the ketogenic biochemical pathway, started to oscillate in the serum and the intestine with the same profile of PPAR-alpha target genes.</b>" <a href="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" title="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" class="https">https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" class="https">https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4</a> and <b>lay public summary</b> <b>BEST: differential effect on intestine and liver, one is phase advanced, the other delayed): Ketogenic diet rewires circadian clock, Claire Greenhill, Nature Reviews Endocrinology</b> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" class="https">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129</a></li>

<li>BEST ME: initial idea back: shortening of tau + phase advance, use anything possible to do that, so can combine food and light for example, maybe multiple zeitgebers control has a cumulative effect? (ie, controlling food + controlling light = 2x phase advance and tau shortening than food or light alone).</li>
<li>Postprandial sleepiness (tiredness after eating, particularly at lunch, and particularly with high-carb diet/meal), is attributable to the effect of proteins increasing levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which itself promotes melatonin, the sleep hormone. In addition, carbohydrates help assimilation of tryptophan into serotonin. So a ketogenic diet is likely to increase vigilance, at the expense of mood issues, but may be alleviated maybe by complemeting with 5-HTP complement (but beware of serotoninergic syndrome, which is deadly!).

<li>"There is increasing evidence of a genetic component to N24. In most cases it is not a simple inherited genetic condition (Medelian inheritance). Most patients with N24 do not have parents or close relatives with the condition."</li>
<li>"However, there do seem to be several genetic factors which can predispose someone to the development of N24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
One study found specific genetic changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in the gene BHLHE40 in 4 patients with N24. As this gene encodes components of the cellular clock, such mutations may affect clock function leading to the abnormalities noted in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
A separate study of 67 N24 patients found an association with polymorphisms in the PER3 gene. PER3 also encodes a crucial component of the circadian clock. The same polymorphisms were associated with extreme evening chronotype – a genetic predisposition to functioning better late in the day, a tendency which is also noted in Non-24s. Variations in the PER3 gene (both SNPs and repeat numbers) are believed to affect free-running period (in animals), the homeostatic drive for sleep (in humans) and the response to light (in humans). All of these factors have been hypothesized, with some evidence, to be abnormal in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
DSPD, a condition related to N24, has been linked to the presence of a mutation in the CRY1 gene, which plays a role in the circadian clock, in a study of one family.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Several genome-wide association studies – genetic screenings of over 100,000 persons — have shown genetic associations with human chronotypes. <b>While these studies did not involve N24 patients specifically, N24 is closely related to extreme evening chronotype, suggesting some of the same genetic factors may be relevant.</b>"

<li>BEST ME: in discussion, propose there are several types of etiologies of non24, and each etiology has a different response to treatments: hyporesponse to light indicates a good response to strong light therapy, mistimed endogenous melatonin may indicate exogenous melatonin, and insulin hormone missignalling, potentially with insulin resistance and metabolic syndromes predisposition, may indicate the ketogenic diet to favor intestine's rhythm (regulated by food) over the liver's (regulated by insulin).</li>

<li>Melanopsin eye receptors: "En 2002, Dr David Berson de l'Université Brow aux USA, a découvert le chaînon manquant des mécanismes de régulation de l'horloge biologique: les cellules ganglionnaires de la rétine interne (devant les bâtonnets et les cônes) contiennent un pigment photosensible appelé ‘mélanopsine'. Ce récepteur nouvellement découvert s'associait parfaitement avec le «spectre d'action» de la lumière bleue. Maintenant que les scientifiques ont identifié la mélanopsine, ils ont pu retracer ses projections via le tractus rétino-hypothalamique au SCN dans l'hypothalamus et d'autres zones dans le cerveau. (1) Cette découverte signifie que les yeux transmettent aussi la lumière mais à travers un système non visuel et les études comparant le système visuel et le système non visuel montrent que la piste de la lumière bleue sur la mélanopsine était non seulement responsable de la régulation de notre système circadien, mais également du système responsable de la vigilance." <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html" title="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html" class="https">https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-melatonine.html</a>

D'un autre côté, des molécules non spécialisées qui peuvent absorber la lumière mais qui ne sont pas intégrées à un organe récepteur de lumière sont appelée « photo accepteurs ». Quoique les « photo accepteurs » peuvent potentiellement absorber la lumière, ils font partie habituellement de voies métaboliques qui ne sont pas directement liées avec le traitement de la lumière. Les « photo accepteurs » sont plus abondants et omniprésents que les « photo-récepteurs». Les molécules « photo accepteurs » qui sont capables d'absorber la lumière et d'exercer des changements dans la fonction ou la structure de la cellule se trouvent dans pratiquement toutes les cellules vivantes et pas seulement celles des organes sensoriels spécialisés comme l'œil." <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html" title="https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html" class="https">https://www.psio.com/fr/LLLT.html</a> - low level light therapy (red) - but also used as placebo for blue light devices!<br>
"Les cellules ganglionnaire de la rétine, par exemple, fournissent l'information sur la luminance de l'environnement au système de régulation des rythmes circadiens et règle par ailleurs le réflex pupillaire. La mélanopsine absorbe la lumière via un chromophore rétine-aldéhyde ce qui conduit à une modification du potentiel membranaire via une cascade de signalisation avec des G-protéines. La glande pinéale quant à elle contient la pinopsin, un photorécepteur similaire qui est sensible à 470 nm qui est exclusivement exprimé dans cet organe et non exprimé dans la rétine ou ailleurs dans le cerveau. C'est grâce à la pinopsin que le pacemaker circadien contrôle la production de mélatonine indépendamment des voies visuelles (cônes et bâtonnets)."<br>
" A ce propos, l'hémoglobine semble remporter la palme des « photoaccepteurs » les plus sensibles dans des tissus aussi variés que les cellules neurales, les fibroblastes et les cellules de l'épithélium.

[...] Non-24 makes your sleep schedule unpredictable day-to-day. You might get up 1+ hours later than the day before, but professional and social functions (the ones you don't miss) will interfere with your normal sleep patterns and fragment your sleep. Unlike DSPS, you can't ask for something like a late shift. With non-24, one day might need to be a late shift, another might need to be an early shift, and maybe another you'll be sleeping from 9 AM - 5 PM, all on short notice. [...] The accommodations you want are something along the lines of (a) give me flexibility in the hours that I work; (b) don't confuse tiredness for lack of professionalism; and (c) excuse me from non-essential functions if I am too tired to attend. I think that the current understanding of sleep disorders is too immature to overcome the inherent biases and misguided beliefs of ordinary people when it comes to a conceptually confusing and rare disorder. [...] It may be emotionally draining to explain your disorder, which is probably very private to you, only for your needs to be disregarded.

A number of minor metabolites are also formed, including the glucuronide conjugate. N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-methoxykynuramine and N1-acetyl-5-methoxy-kynuramine, were initially reported as brain metabolites (1, 16) but have proved difficult to detect in plasma or urine except after administration of exogenous melatonin (17). <b>Exogenous oral fast release</b> or intravenous melatonin <b>has a short metabolic half-life (20 to 60 min, depending on author and species)</b>, with a large hepatic first pass effect and a biphasic elimination pattern (18). Slow release/prolonged release/surge sustained preparations are of course designed to extend the time of high circulating melatonin [e.g., (19)]. It has low bioavailability in general although transmucosal administration increases bioavailability (20). <b>A critical feature of exogenous melatonin with regard to its clinical uses is its very low toxicity and lack of addictive properties</b> (21, 22)." <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" title="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" class="https">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full</a> by Josephine Arendt!!

+ melatonin effect on mood: "Evidence is accumulating that delayed melatonin offset is associated with unipolar depressions,7,71,72,73,74,75 as suggested in Figure 10. The current results indicate that melatonin offset could become delayed due in part to several polymorphisms which delay circadian rhythm systems. Conversely, it is well known that a person's illumination exposure, particularly exposure to bright morning light, may cause melatonin secretion to terminate earlier in the morning, not only because bright light suppresses melatonin acutely, but also because it advances the "morning oscillator" component of the complex circadian oscillator composed of particular cell groups within the suprachiasmatic nuclei.76,77 Morning bright light tends to be antidepressant.78 In general, effects of bright light on mood seem to be mediated through retino-hypothalamic tract effects on the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which in turn regulates the timing of melatonin release from the pineal. Likewise, suppression of morning melatonin by propranolol can be antidepressant.79"<br>

MDPI, predatory publisher! melatonin biology: "Melatonin, N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is an indole mainly synthesized from tryptophan in the pineal gland and secreted exclusively during the night in all the animals reported to date. While the pineal gland is the major source responsible for this night rise, it is not at all the exclusive production site and many other tissues and organs produce melatonin as well. Likewise, melatonin is not restricted to vertebrates, as its presence has been reported in almost all the phyla from protozoa to mammals. <b>Melatonin displays a large set of functions including adaptation to light: dark cycles, free radical scavenging ability, antioxidant enzyme modulation, immunomodulatory actions or differentiation⁻proliferation regulatory effects, among others.

<li><b>melatonin biology in all cells (via mitochondria)</b>: "Melatonin is a well-known, nighttime-produced indole found in bacteria, eukaryotic unicellulars, animals or vascular plants. In vertebrates, melatonin is the major product of the pineal gland, which accounts for its increase in serum during the dark phase, but it is also produced by many other organs and cell types. Such a wide distribution is consistent with its multiple and well-described functions which include from the circadian regulation and adaptation to seasonal variations to immunomodulatory and oncostatic actions in different types of tumors. The discovery of its antioxidant properties in the early 1990s opened a new field of potential protective functions in multiple tissues. A special mention should be made regarding the nervous system, where <b>the indole is considered a major neuroprotector</b>.

<li>"Diets are currently characterized by elevated sugar intake, mainly due to the increased consumption of processed sweetened foods and drinks during the last 40 years. Diet is the main source of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). These are toxic compounds formed during the Maillard reaction, which takes place both in vivo, in tissues and fluids under physiological conditions, favored by sugar intake, and ex vivo during food preparation such as baking, cooking, frying or storage. Protein glycation occurs slowly and continuously through life, driving AGE accumulation in tissues during aging. For this reason, AGEs have been proposed as a risk factor in the pathogenesis of diet-related diseases such as diabetes, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases, kidney injury, and age-related and neurodegenerative diseases." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32041293</a></li>
<li>"Melatonin (MT), an indole formed enzymatically from L-trytophan (Trp), was first discovered in the bovine pineal gland in 1958 by Lerner et al. Melatonin is the most versatile and ubiquitous hormonal molecule produced not only in the pineal gland but also in various other tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). This review focuses on the localization, production, metabolism and the functions of MT in GIT and the duodenal unit (liver, biliary routes and pancreas), where multi-step biosynthetic pathways of this indole, similar to those in pinealocytes, have been identified." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928638</a></li>
<li>"Melatonin,N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a hormonal product of the pineal gland. Its synthesis is higher at night than during the day in all vertebrates including man. Once melatonin is produced in the pineal gland it is quickly released into the vascular system. The rapid release of melatonin is generally believed to relate to its high lipophilicity which allows it to readily pass through the membrane of the pinealocytes and the endothelial cells which line the capillaries. The result of the nocturnal synthesis and secretion of melatonin is high blood levels at night. Also because of its highly lipophilic nature, melatonin from the blood readily escapes into every other bodily fluid and all cells in the body. Until recently it was generally thought that melatonin's action in the organism depended on its exclusive interaction with specific receptors on cells located in discrete locations. Certainly, the interactions of melatonin with these membrane-bound receptors are believed to mediate the endocrine and circadian rhythm effects of melatonin. It was recently discovered, however, that melatonin's primary action may not depend on the previously described membrane receptors. We have found that melatonin is a very potent hydroxyl radical scavenger; free radicals and the hydroxyl radical in particular, because of its very high reactivity, can be extremely damaging to macromolecules in cells. Compared to glutathione and mannitol, two well known free radical scavengers, melatonin is a more powerful scavenger and affords protection of molecules, especially DNA, from oxidative damage. Melatonin's extremely high diffusibility is important for its scavenging action because this feature allows it to enter all cells and every subcellular compartment. Whereas the free radical quenching activity of melatonin does not require a receptor, we also have evidence that it may be bound in the nucleus thereby providing on-site protection to DNA. Besides scavenging the highly toxic hydroxyl radical, melatonin also stimulates glutathione peroxidase activity which metabolizes the precursor of the hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, to water. Thus, melatonin has at least two means to protect the cell from oxidative damage, i.e., it breaks down hydrogen peroxide to harmless water and, in the event any hydroxyl radicals are formed, melatonin scavenges them. Melatonin may be the premier molecule to protect the organism from oxidative damage." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8136717</a></li>

Light is the strongest realigning stimulus and careful timing of light exposure and avoidance can promote adjustment. Chronobiotics such as melatonin can also be used to realign the circadian clock but, as well as timing and dosage issues, there are also concerns as to its legal status in different countries and with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

<li>SUMMARY: MTNR1B expression in carriers of the rs10830963 variant have increases in glucose tolerance when concomittant with melatonin (exogenous). A previous study by the same group has shown that daytime exogenous melatonin intake increased both glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. The effect is strong, this genetic variant explains 25% of the variance of glucose profile. Even in normal-weight and nondiabetic participants. This genetic variant may promote progression from normal to a prediabetic state.</li>
<li>"Genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) have found an association between MTNR1B rs10830963 and increased fasting plasma glucose levels and T2D risk [1, 2, 6]. Follow-up studies confirmed this association with T2D risk [7–9]. However, although the genetic association of rs10830963 with T2D risk is now established, the functional impact of this MTNR1B variant on glucose control is poorly characterized"</li>
<li>"Importantly, among more than 60 variants associated with T2D and/or glycemic traits, the common MTNR1B risk variant rs10830963 had the most significant adverse influence on the disposition index, a product of both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity, as estimated by an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [12]."</li>
<li>"Despite GWAS have provided robust evidence for an association of the common MTNR1B risk variant with glycemic traits, the magnitude of its effect is small. <b>Notably, all the metabolic assessments in these GWAS were performed during daytime hours when endogenous melatonin concentrations were very low or absent</b> [13]."</li>
<li>"A new approach to investigate the role of melatonin and the MTNR1B diabetes risk variant in glucose metabolism could be to test the effect of exogenous melatonin administration during the daytime on glucose metabolism between carriers and non-carriers of the MTNR1B risk variant. The aim of the current study was to assess whether MTNR1B rs10830963 influences the magnitude of effect of exogenous melatonin administration on glucose tolerance at different times of the day (morning and evening), as compared to placebo administration."</li>

<li>"The current data revealed a common variant that increased this deleterious effect of melatonin on glucose AUC by 6 fold as compared to that in the non-carriers.The relative risk of the genetic variant in glucose AUC was exceptionally large for genetic studies.

<li>"The rs10830963-G allele has recently been implicated in the transition of normoglycemia to a state of impaired fasting glucose [23]. It has been postulated that this particular variant promotes the progression from a normal to a prediabetic state rather than the progression from a prediabetic to a diabetic state [23]. Further interventional studies in shift workers will help to determine <b>whether changing the timing of food intake to avoid concurrent exposure to melatonin can improve glucose tolerance.</b>"</li>
<li>"The strong effect and high prevalence of this genetic variant (MAF: ~30%; thus, 51% are carriers among a population of European ancestry), as well as the common use of melatonin supplementation (over-the-counter or by prescription), make our findings particularly relevant for clinical practice, not only for treatment but also for preventive purposes. Regarding the use of exogenous melatonin, identifying individuals with the rs10830963-G allele may be helpful to provide personalized recommendations about the relative timing of food consumption and melatonin administration."</li>

Lane et al, Diabetes, 2016 : "The risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increased by abnormalities in sleep quantity and quality, circadian alignment, and melatonin regulation. A common genetic variant in a receptor for the circadian-regulated hormone melatonin (MTNR1B) is associated with increased fasting blood glucose and risk of T2D, but whether sleep or circadian disruption mediates this risk is unknown. We aimed to test if MTNR1B diabetes risk variant rs10830963 associates with measures of sleep or circadian physiology in intensive in-laboratory protocols (n = 58-96) or cross-sectional studies with sleep quantity and quality and timing measures from self-report (n = 4,307-10,332), actigraphy (n = 1,513), or polysomnography (n = 3,021). In the in-laboratory studies, we found a significant association with <b>a substantially longer duration of elevated melatonin levels (41 min) and delayed circadian phase of dim-light melatonin offset (1.37 h), partially mediated through delayed offset of melatonin synthesis</b>. Furthermore, increased T2D risk in MTNR1B risk allele carriers was more pronounced in early risers versus late risers as determined by 7 days of actigraphy. Our results provide the surprising insight that <b>the MTNR1B risk allele influences dynamics of melatonin secretion, generating a novel hypothesis that the MTNR1B risk allele may extend the duration of endogenous melatonin production later into the morning and that early waking may magnify the diabetes risk conferred by the risk allele</b>." → early risers = DSPD who try to conform to standard schedule. How can I be sure? Because they have delayed melatonin production late into the morning but still wake up early!
<ul>
<li>"In humans, the release of melatonin occurs concurrent with overnight fasting during sleep. Elevated melatonin levels during an oral glucose load during the day causes impaired glucose tolerance (6,10)."</li>
<li>"Common variants in MTNR1B associate with increased risk of T2D, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (7,8), and lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in individuals without diabetes (11). Functional studies have established that MTNR1B rs10830963 is the likely causal variant (12). Strong independent association of rare, loss-of-function variants in MTNR1B with increased risk of T2D further implicates MTNR1B as the most likely causal gene in the region (13)."</li>
<li>BEST: " In the in-laboratory studies, we found significant associations between MTNR1B diabetes risk variant rs10830963G and timing of the melatonin rhythm: an allelic dose-dependent delayed DLMOff by 1 h and 22 min (β = 1.36 h, 95% CI 0.28–2.44, N = 95, P = 0.015, r2 = 19%) and a longer duration of elevated melatonin levels by 41 min during constant routine protocols (defined as the difference between DLMO and DLMOff) (β = 41 min, 95% CI 4.2–78, N = 94, P = 0.032, r2 = 2.5%).

<li>"We then asked if melatonin synthesis offset accounts for the relationship between rs10830963 and delayed DLMOff. A suggestive association of the risk allele with delayed melatonin synthesis offset (β = 1.05 h, 95% CI −0.17 to −2.28, N = 82, P = 0.097) was observed, and after conditioning on melatonin synthesis offset, the effect of rs10830963 on DLMOff was halved (βconditional = 0.65 h, 95% CI −0.066 to 1.366, P = 0.079, PANOVA &lt; 0.001), suggesting partial mediation. Additional adjustment for season of study had no effect (data not shown). We tested if chronotype or sleep timing contributes to the association between rs10830963 and DLMOff. We found significant mediation by sleep timing (bedtime 82.3%, P = 0.05; midpoint 84.4%, P = 0.04; wake time 85.9%, P = 0.05; chronotype (MEQ) 47.7%, P = 0.13), although a small portion of the effect is independent of sleep timing. <b>The relationship between rs10830963 and melatonin duration is not mediated by sleep duration (P = 0.24).</b>"</li>
<li>BEST: "Objectively measured sleep timing (7-day actigraphy) significantly modified the effect of rs10830963 on T2D risk, such that earlier sleep timing in combination with the G allele carries an increased risk compared with later sleep timing. In analyses of participants of European descent stratified by median bedtime, midpoint, and wake time, a significant association between rs10830963 genotype and T2D was seen in early sleep timing, but not in late sleep timing (bedtime ≥23:12), independent of sleep duration. <b>Thus, the effect of rs10830963 on risk of T2D may be modified by sleep timing, with risk allele carriers with earlier sleep timing at an increased risk</b>."</li>
<li><b>BEST: for DSPD who are sleeping very late, light exposure would inhibit the end of the melatonin profile:</b> "We hypothesized that a common T2D risk variant in MTNR1B would be associated with melatonin, sleep, or circadian traits.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the increased T2D risk in rs10830963G carriers is more pronounced in early sleep timing and <b>almost absent in late sleep timing</b>, in which <b>an extended morning melatonin profile would be obscured by the later rise time</b>. Thus, taken together, <b>our data suggest that MTNR1B rs10830963G extends the duration of melatonin production later into the morning, and waking up earlier in the morning magnifies the diabetes risk with MTNR1B genotype.</b>"</li>
<li>"<b>Delayed DLMOff and a longer duration of melatonin in risk allele carriers may result in an increased risk for food intake to coincide with elevated melatonin levels in the morning, leading to decreased glucose tolerance and possibly elevated diabetes risk.</b> Consistently, risk allele carriers with earlier sleep timing have an increased T2D risk, possibly due to concomitant food intake and elevated melatonin levels in the morning. In addition to the adverse effects of an increase in melatonin levels into daytime, a reduction in nighttime melatonin signaling also appears to be deleterious. Reduced nighttime melatonin signaling, either by MTNR1B receptor rare loss-of-function variants (13) or reduced nighttime melatonin levels (5), is associated with an increased risk of T2D."</li>

<li>"Under entrained conditions, the accumulation of homeostatic sleep pressure in the evening is opposed by a strong circadian arousal signal prior to the dim light melatonin onset, called the Wake Maintenance Zone (WMZ). [...] Participants improved in cognitive response inhibition during WMZ1 (13.5 h awake) and sustained attention during WMZ2 (37.5 h awake), but not in higher executive function tests. [...] EEG power reductions coincided during WMZ1 with stable subjective sleepiness and sustained attention. During WMZ2, EEG power reductions were more pronounced and coincided with improved sustained attention. <b>Our results suggest the circadian arousal signal in the evening differently modulates cognitive functions and EEG power depending on the duration of prior wakefulness</b>."</li>

<li>BEST PROTOCOLS: "Instead, sleep propensity (the tendency to fall asleep) is also modulated by a circadian process. The circadian component (Process C) regulates the endogenous circadian rhythm of sleep-wake regulation across 24 hours1 and is governed by the biological clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN)7. <b>Both processes interact with each other and can only be determined separately by means of specialized protocols such as the forced desynchrony protocol8 or nap paradigms9.</b>"</li>
<li>"When analyzing the circadian impact on sleep propensity under these conditions, the circadian drive for sleep is very low in the early evening before bedtime, shortly before the secretion onset of the pineal hormone melatonin8. At first glance, this may seem counterintuitive, because <b>it implies a high circadian drive for alertness in the evening</b>8–12. Yet, it was shown that the circadian arousal signal in the early evening <b>leads to higher subjective and objective alertness and is thus opposing the accumulated homeostatic sleep pressure</b> - a phenomenon called the <b>‘wake maintenance zone’ (WMZ) or ‘forbidden zone of sleep’</b>5,9,11."</li>
<li>"Cognitive performance, as well as subjective and objective alertness, is also high during the WMZ in the evening15–24. Significant performance improvements of sustained attention occur during the WMZ, both after a normal duration of prior wakefulness as well as after sleep deprivation16. Better working memory performance during the WMZ has been linked to sleep-dependent higher hypothalamic activation as assessed in the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response of the MRI after a normal duration of prior wakefulness, but not after very low or very high sleep pressure conditions25. These studies suggest a differential impact on cognitive performance during the WMZ, depending on the duration of prior wakefulness."</li>

SD also accounts for 20% of all serious car accidents, which is equivalent to those attributed to alcohol (Connor et al., 2002). Accidents associated with SD are partially attributed to fatigue related performance failures (Colten and Altevogt, 2006).

<ul>
<li>ME: Thank you VERY much for these studies that nicely complement the one I posted! Indeed sleep inertia isn't tackled in the study, but I guess it's because the setup and goal is different, the nap duration (up to 2h in the study I posted) is significantly longer than in these studies (max 60 min in the third study).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
However, although there is certainly sleep inertia when having a long nap (probably because of going to deep sleep?), the third and even the second study confirm that when one needs to stay awake for a long period of time post-nap, it's better to have a longer nap than a short one.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
If I would submit a hypothesis, I would say that a short nap reduces adenosine levels and the homeostatic process S, but does not produces brain and body repairs as can be done during a full night of sleep, because most of these repairs are done during deep sleep (slow wave sleep SWS), which happens only with longer naps.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So for people who are NOT sleep deprived but feel a bit sleepy, eg after lunch eating because of postprandial sleepiness, then a short nap is more beneficial, but for people who are constantly sleep deprived, slow wave sleep is what is necessary to reduce the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation, and hence longer naps should be preferred.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Note however that in my experience, even long naps can't replace a full night of sleep, I can never sleep as much during a nap however long it is as I can during my natural night. I think the mismatch between circadian rhythm and sleep pressure is a factor that can explain this reduction of sleep duration, and it's certainly not good in the long run, so I'm not advising anyone to just sustain on long naps, but if there is no choice for some days or a period of time, then it's better than just doing all nighters or using wakefulness promoting drugs without a doubt.

<li>"these decrements in performance are exaggerated by prior sleep loss and the time of day in which a person awakens."</li>
<li>ME: So it may not be only the nap duration but also the chronic sleep deprivation AND the misalignment with the circadian rhythm that causes sleep inertia</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>BEST: confirmation that chronic sleep deprivation causes sleep inertia</b>: Chronic sleep restriction greatly magnifies performance decrements immediately after awakening. Sleep. 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039</a>
<ul>
<li>"These impairments in performance during sleep inertia occurred after only chronic exposure to sleep restriction and were even worse after awakenings during the biological nighttime. Interestingly, despite differences in objective performance, there were no significant differences between groups in subjective levels of sleepiness during sleep inertia. <b>[Chronic sleep deprivation] worsens sleep inertia, especially for awakenings during the biological night</b>."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT ME SUMMARY: chronic sleep deprivation worsen circadian misalignment at least via 2 known processes: by increasing sleep inertia (ie, difficulty to wake up and sustain high cognitive performance), and by raising dopamine levels and thus countering the homeostatic sleep pressure process S and hence making it more difficult to fall asleep. The combination of both makes it extremely difficult to both fall asleep and wake up at a regular time.</li>

<li>"A major challenge in accelerometer-based sleep measurement is to derive sleep parameters without additional information from sleep diaries1,3,7. Standard methods for sleep detection based on conventional accelerometers (actigraphy) involves asking the participant to record their time in bed, sleep onset, and waking up time8,9,10. In a previous paper we developed a method to detect sleep guided by sleep diary records11. However, the increasing use of accelerometry in studies worldwide without sleep diaries necessitates the development of novel methods to derive indicators of sleep behaviour, in the absence of sleep diary records. A crucial step is the detection of the sleep period time window (SPT-window), which is the time window starting at sleep onset and ending when waking up after the last sleep episode of the night. Once the SPT-window can be detected without a diary, our previously published method can be used to detect sleep episodes within this window11."</li>

<li>Fast decrease in temperature following sleep deprivation! "Sleep deprivation alters thermoregulatory responses. We used control of skin temperature to produce mild thermal challenge, both cool (32 degrees C) and warm (38 degrees C), and recorded esophageal and rectal temperatures, sweat rate and forearm blood flow in six healthy young women at rest. We discovered that after one night of sleep deprivation (1) both mean esophageal and rectal temperatures were reduced, (2) the mean threshold for sweating was not altered, and (3) there was no direct indication that skin blood flow was set at different levels with skin temperature neutral or cool. Peripheral vasodilation was attenuated when skin temperature was held at 38 degrees C. Following this period of mild hyperthermia, esophageal and rectal temperatures decreased much more rapidly in sleep-deprived subjects when skin temperature was cooled and held constant at 32 degrees C. We conclude that sleep-deprived women lose heat rapidly in response to a mild cooling stimulus. Sleep-deprived humans may be more vulnerable to heat loss with reduced ability to warm even at temperatures thought to be associated with thermal comfort."</li>

<li>BEST: <b>polysomnography = combination of multiple devices</b>: "PSG tests are the ultimate proving ground as they capture as much data as possible: brain activity with electroencephalogram (EEG), eye patterns, muscle movement, and two types of heart rate data from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmography (PPG)." <a href="https://ouraring.com/oura-validation-psg" title="https://ouraring.com/oura-validation-psg" class="https">https://ouraring.com/oura-validation-psg</a></li>
<li><b>BEST REF &amp; METHODS:</b> on reliability and accuracy of thermometers relatively to core body temperature: Rubia-Rubia, J., Arias, A., Sierra, A., &amp; Aguirre-Jaime, A. (2011). <b>Measurement of body temperature in adult patients: comparative study of accuracy, reliability and validity of different devices. International Journal of Nursing Studies</b>, 48(7), 872–880. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003</a>

<li>"For an error of ±0.2 °C and concordance with respect to fever, the gallium-in-glass thermometer gave the best results. The largest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is obtained by the digital axillar thermometer with probe (0.988 ± 0.007). The minimum difference between readings was given by the infrared ear thermometer, in comparison with the core temperature (−0.1 ± 0.3 °C)."</li>
<li>"The <b>compact digital axillar thermometer</b> and the digital thermometer with probe obtained the highest overall valuation score." → armpit measurement by contact is a very good measure site for core body temperature! Better than infrared!</li>
<li>"If we only evaluate the aspects of validity, reliability, accuracy and external influence, the best thermometer would be the gallium-in-glass after 12 min. The gallium-in-glass thermometer is less accurate after only 5 min in comparison with the reading taken after being placed for 12 min. If we add the evaluation of waste production, ease-of-use, speed, durability, security, patient comfort and costs, the thermometers that obtain the highest score are the compact digital and digital with probe in right axilla."</li>
<li>"We find that some of the factors studied do have an influence on differences in readings, but not with all thermometers, so a reliable reading from different kinds of thermometer will depend on minimising the particular factors that affect them."</li>
<li>BEST for DOC: "Although we believe that it might have some influence on the difference in readings, the dominant arm of patients does not reach statistical significance, either in studies revised, or in ours. Male sex, weight, age and <b>consciousness</b> are factors contributing to an increase in the difference in the temperature measured in the pulmonary artery in most thermometers, although we were unable to find a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. Although one study (Giuliano et al., 1999) found no correlation between ambient temperature and the differences in the temperature measured, we did find one when using digital probe and infrared ear in oral equivalency thermometers, in that the differences in the readings increased at lower ambient temperature, which is surprising when one takes into account the different anatomical situations of the readings affected by this factor. We feel, however, that it is a factor which has to be taken more into consideration, when measuring the body temperature, since a change in the ambient temperature of 5C during the day for examples, could give a difference in the reading of between 0.3C and 0.9C."</li>
<li>No unequivocally best thermometer, but there are better thermometers: "As there is no core temperature as a fever reference, we chose three arbitrary temperatures as a standard for analysing validity. We expected the different thermometers to give similar results for all of these references, but no single thermometer turned out to be the most valid for each reference core temperature by the area under the ROC curve; and the false negatives, positive predictive value and the specificity also fluctuate for the same thermometers. These results cannot be compared with the results of similar studies, in which such an analysis is not conducted. We could consider the compact digital axillar thermometer with probe as the most valid, although the heterogeneity of the validity parameters of each thermometer, dependent on the core temperature chosen as a reference, makes an unequivocal choice impossible."</li>
<li>"The assessment of reliability varies from one study to another. The non-statistical significance of the differences of readings between thermometers and observers (Farnell et al., 2005), the intra-observer reproducibility using repetitions of the measurements based on variance analysis (Giuliano et al., 1999), the magnitude of the difference between readings according to the standard deviation (Erickson and Kirklin, 1993) or the correlation between readings as a measure of agreement (Myny et al., 2005) are all used as the criteria of agreement. All of these ways of assessing reliability are inadequate as the differences between readings may not reach statistical significance while still being substantial. The typical deviation of these differences only indicates their symmetrical dispersion in 68% of the sample and <b>it is impossible for simultaneous measurements taken with similar instruments not to show a high degree of correlation</b>." → any thermometer will correlate with others. The question is which one is closer to core body temperature, and there is no definite answer, because there is no single core body temperature...</li>
<li>Infra-red sensors are the worst... "the lowest degree of agreement is presented by the ear and the infrared frontal thermometers, while all the rest are acceptable on this point [...] When we use the ‘‘fever’’ and ‘‘no fever’’ classification of readings, according to the cut-off points for each thermometer in comparison with the core reference temperature, the concordance between readings on the same thermometer, intra-observer concordance and concordance between observers is poor for the infrared thermometers and adequate for all the rest."</li>

<li>DHF (dual heat flux or DHFM, at least 4 sensors, not just 2) and ZHF (zero heat flux) are promising but not validated yet, only rectal temperature is.</li>
<li>Predictive technologies from heartbeat or fusion sensor are promising (quick review of models in the article).</li>
<li>"The DHFM calculates internal body temperature based on the heat flow from the human body into a thermometer using <b>at least four temperature sensors</b> (Huang et al., 2016; 2017). Feng et al. (2017) reported that the difference of measured temperature between the DHFM and sublingual temperature was 0.13 ± 0.22°C at rest and 1.36 ± 0.44°C during exercise, while Huang et al. (2016) compared the DHFM to aural temperature. However, both the sublingual and aural temperature methods are not validated and are not the gold standard of internal body temperature assessment, and these studies have therefore not successfully demonstrated validation of the DHFM method."</li>
<li>"Common themes among published models include environmental temperature and humidity, skin temperature, and heart rate sensing requirements (Fiala et al., 2012; Kim &amp; Lee, 2016; Niedermann et al., 2014; Richmond et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2013). The simplest models rely on only one or two measurements (Kim &amp; Lee, 2016; Xu et al., 2013)."</li>
<li>"More recently, models which consider a more integrative approach to thermal physiology have emerged. These models rely on the interactions between physiological systems to reduce the requirements for multiple sensors and assumptions. Principally, among these models are those which rely on <b>sequential heart rate measurements to represent the strong interaction between the cardiovascular and thermoregulatory systems (Buller et al., 2013; 2018; Laxminarayan et al., 2018)</b>." → core body temperature approximation from heart rate, see also: </li>
<li>"These authors demonstrated that <b>ZHF tracked internal body temperature as measured by esophageal temperature with almost no time delay during exercise</b> (the ZHF temperature - esophageal temperature = -0.05 ± 0.18°C) and recovery (the ZHF temperature - esophageal temperature = -0.01 ± 0.20°C) (Teunissen et al., 2011). However, internal body temperature did not exceed 38.5°C in this study as well; thus, the validity of higher internal body temperature measurement by ZHF remains to be tested."</li>
<li>"In addition to the DHFM and ZHF methods, Ota et al. (2017) demonstrated a 3D printed “earable” smart device to measure internal body temperature with an integrated bone conduction hearing aid."</li>

<li>"One of the earliest efforts to develop a sensor for core body temperature measurement from surface measurements has been based on <b>zero heat flow</b> method (Fox, Solman, Isaacs &amp; MacDonald 1973). The method uses a heater to create a zone of <b>zero heat flux</b> such that the skin temperature under the sensor reaches the core temperature. Studies have shown the effectiveness of this method except during exceptional rapid cooling or heating as the response time is around 15 to 20 minutes when applied to forehead (Togawa 1985). There have been other attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of this scheme for different applications (Zeiner et.al. 2010) (Teunissen et.al. 2011). However, the use of a heating element creates problems for applications which involve mobility and require low power consumption. <b>New technique which does not involve the use of heater and is based on a double sensor has been reported for monitoring heat strains</b> (Gunga et.al. 2008) and also for space applications (Gunga et.al. 2009). The design uses <b>two temperature sensors separated by an insulating layer</b> whose thermal conductivity is known. By measuring the skin temperature and the temperature at the upper sensor and knowing the thermal conductivity of human tissue, the core temperature can be calculated. However, this technique still requires the correct knowledge of the thermal conductivity of the epidermal tissues where the sensor is placed. Another solution has been proposed using two heat flow channels in parallel (Kitamura, Zhu, Chen &amp; Nemoto 2010). This work avoids the dependence on knowledge of the thermal properties of tissue below the sensor. Its performance has been compared to the zero heat flux method. Further work has been presented to improve the response time (Sim, Lee, Baek &amp; Park 2012). These present interesting ideas for use in continuous monitoring applications."</li>
<li>"Another important aspect that has not been studied so far is the use at a measurement site other than the forehead. If the sensor can be used at a location between the abdomen and chest, it can be coupled with other vital parameter measurements on a single sensing device. However, the layer of adipose tissues is significantly lesser for neonates and hence data obtained on adults and neonates could vary."</li>
<li>"Another very important aspect for future work is to develop a good model incorporating multiple tissue layers and blood perfusion using Penne’s Bioheat equations instead of simple heat transfer models. It could be interesting if some of the parameters can be learnt from data obtained through continuous measurements and be able to predict conditions like increased blood perfusion due to exposure to cold and compensate for differences in core temperature measurements. It would also help in validating the assumption that the effective thermal resistance of tissue below the sensor is same for both parallel heat flow channels."</li>

<li>"ZHF thermometry’s ability to measure temperature up to <b>a depth of approximately 2 cm</b> makes it a useful non-invasive tool for brain temperature monitoring.[6, 7]"</li>
<li>For consciousness preservation: "<b>Hypothermia (brain temperature &lt; 35°C) shows great promise to minimize neural damage</b> in patients with <b>cardiopulmonary arrest and traumatic head injuries</b>.[1, 2] However, cooling the whole body below 33-34°C can induce severe complications.[3] Arrhythmia, infection and primary coagulopathy are the most commonly noted complications.[3] We have developed a <b>Selective Brain Cooling (SBC) approach which can be initiated early after injury</b>, induces rapid cooling and maintains the target brain temperature over an extended period of time before slowly rewarming without significantly affecting the core body temperature.[4] In our experiments, brain temperature was measured invasively by inserting a thermocouple probe into the brain parenchyma, which measured brain temperature accurately but is invasive, making it unsuitable for most patients. Invasive intracranial probe also can have complications such as intracranial hemorrhage or hematoma and infection.[5]"</li>
<li>zero-heat-flux works better where skull thickness is thinnest and there is cerebral tissue (no air or fluid) at 2cm below (can check on CT scan or MRI): "Several factors contributed to this discrepancy. One factor was the skull thickness which was the thinnest at location #2 as verified by CT images (Fig. 1). Second, at location #2, the region underneath the Bair HuggerTM sensor was all brain tissue without the presence of air in the sinuses or extracranial tissue. The error in the Bair HuggerTM sensor is caused by admixture of brain tissue, air and extracranial tissue in its monitoring region. This could explain the greater temperature difference between the intracranial thermocouple probe and Bair HuggerTM sensor at location #1 and #3."</li>
<li>"The difference between a positive patient outcome and a complicated recovery can be a matter of degrees. Unintended perioperative hypothermia is a frequent, yet preventable, complication of surgery. It can increase the rate of surgical site infection (SSI),¹ extend recovery time² and length of stay,¹ and increase mortality rates.³" <a href="https://www.bairhugger.com/3M/en_CA/bair-hugger-ca/" title="https://www.bairhugger.com/3M/en_CA/bair-hugger-ca/" class="https">https://www.bairhugger.com/3M/en_CA/bair-hugger-ca/</a></li>

<li>Wrist temperature more robust to predict circadian rhythm than actigraphy: "As wrist temperature rhythms were not affected by participants’ movements, this supports the usefulness of wrist temperature in more comprehensive and accurate sleep analysis. Lastly, novel two sleep detection algorithms are proposed; one is built solely on wrist temperature, while the other uses features from both wrist temperature and accelerometry. While the wrist temperature alone algorithm performed better than the Mi Band for OAWD, using both data sources showed increases in sleep detection accuracy for all participants it was tested with. Preliminary results show that the wrist temperature has the potential to play a valuable role in better identification and understanding or sleep, including for people with movement-related sleep disorders."

<li>"Our results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to detect <b>wrist temperature increase onset</b>, which <b>appears to occur at the same time for the same person</b>. We also show that temperature increase onset <b>varies between people as does overall temperature patterns between people</b>."</li>
<li>"Many people believe in the proverb "Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise". However, according to chronobiology [12], not everyone is genetically suited to the "early to bed and early to rise" lifestyle. In fact, the definition of "early" varies between person to person due to different circadian rhythms. Therefore, it follows that a better sense of our own circadian rhythms could help us manage our sleep/wake times accordingly to get better sleep."</li>
<li>"Recently, wrist temperature has been shown to be an effective alternative to measuring Core Body Temperature (CBT), which is the current circadian rhythm phase marker gold standard."</li>
<li>"<b>Wrist temperature has been shown to increase at night before people fall asleep and drop drastically when people wake up [14].</b>" JA Sarabia, MA Rol, P Mendiola, and JA Madrid. 2008. Circadian rhythm of wrist temperature in normal-living subjects: A candidate of new index of the circadian system. Physiology &amp; behavior 95, 4 (2008), 570–580</li>
<li>"<b>Wrist temperature increase onset (i.e., where the body starts preparing for sleep) has also been shown to be highly correlative to Dim Light Melatonin Onset (DLMO)</b>, another circadian phase marker gold standard [11]. <b>Compared to CBT and DLMO, which are done with rectal measurements and saliva analysis respectively, measuring wrist temperature is unobtrusive, convenient, and can be done continuously</b>." 11 = Elisabet Ortiz-Tudela, Antonio Martinez-Nicolas, Manuel Campos, María Ángeles Rol, and Juan Antonio Madrid. 2010. A new integrated variable based on thermometry, actimetry and body position (TAP) to evaluate circadian system status in humans. PLoS computational biology 6, 11 (2010), e1000996.</li>
<li>"Ortiz et. al. (2014) proposed a method that integrates temperature and accelerometer sensor data together to determine circadian phase."</li>
<li><b>BEST: combining Axivity AX3 + iButton for temperature near the radial artery of the wrist for circadian rhythm detection via temperature profile:</b> "As there are no available open-data wristbands with a temperature sensor that can measure the temperature of radial artery location, we built our own wristband by modifying a off-the-shelf accelerometer data logger Axivity AX3 sensor (Axivity, York, UK; 100Hz, ±8д, weight: 9g) to include an iButton DS1922L temperature sensor (Maxim, Dallas, US), as can be seen in Figure 1. We 3D printed a holder for the iButton and attached the sensor to the inside of the Axivity wristband. The DS1922L samples data every 5 minutes with resolution of 0.0625℃and sensitivity of 0.5℃. When the participant is wearing the wristband, the temperature sensor stays on the underside of the participant’s wrist and therefore measures the temperature near the radial artery of the wrist."</li>

<li>"With the rapid development of mobile technology, many commercial smart wristbands or smart watches have developed some form of sleep monitoring. Fitbit and Apple Watch estimate users’ sleep quality based on body movement and heart rate. While these biometrics are useful in evaluating sleep duration, <b>they are an "external observation" of sleep; they can only tell you about how you slept. In other words, current wearables can tell you that you had a bad sleep but as they cannot monitor circadian rhythms, therefore cannot help align your sleep/wake times to match your body’s ideal times with respect to biological processes</b>. In addition, as most sleep detection is based on accelerometer sensors and supervised learning algorithms, existing works [6] suggest that sleep/wake status can be better detected with a personalized algorithm that aligns with our own sleep habits and needs." </li>
<li>"Recently, researchers built their own sleep monitoring systems based on programmable commercial Android Wear wristbands [5, 15] by using sensors such as microphones and light sensors to fuse data together and determine light/deep sleep stages. However, there is still little research (e.g., [2, 8]) that have tried to use an integrated single wearable to measure circadian phase indicators and no commercially available wearables exist."</li>
<li>"The sleep/wake time from the sleep journal was used as ground truth; however, when participants reported that they forgot to record their sleep/wake time or experienced insomnia, sleep/wake times were extracted from accelerometer data"</li>
<li>BEST: 2°C to 5°C of difference between lowest (wake-up) and highest (bedtime) temperatures depending on the participant! For wrist temperature. And very stable intra-individually, but 0.5 standard deviation across subjects.</li>
<li>METHOD: "While wrist temperature trends are influenced by circadian rhythms, the wrist region is also exposed to many external factors. For example, the ambient temperature will influence the skin temperature; <b>entering from outside to inside can cause substantial changes in wrist temperature</b>. Factors such as these can "mask" circadian-driven trends of the wrist temperature. Therefore, we needed to create an algorithm that can use a person’s past data to estimate the time of onset of rising wrist temperature, as this mitigates changes from extraneous factors. To achieve this, <b>we averaged wrist temperature for 24-hours (from 3PM to 3PM) for every three days based on timestamps provided by the sensor</b>. Then, we extracted the elevated temperature period (i.e., the person’s sleep period) using the algorithm described in [16] and identified the dip point from the beginning of that period. As shown in our previous work [16], <b>when people delay their sleep, a second and sometimes third dip appears in the rising temperature before sleep onset</b>. In order to identify the first dip point (i.e., the initial rising wrist temperature indicating the body preparing for sleep), we searched for the dip point at one hour, two hours and three hours prior to the onset of sleep, which was taken as the beginning of the stable high-temperature that indicates when a person is asleep. We used findpeaks() in Matlab 2015a to find the dip that had the lowest temperature within each time range. This enabled us to find up to three different dips within one to three hours for the averaged temperature pattern for every three days. For each participant we found the dips for the 14 days of data, after which we calculated the average dip time for the first dip. This average time was considered to be the wrist temperature increase onset for each individual; namely, the start of temperature increase caused by circadian rhythm that indicates the body preparing for sleep." → can't work for non24 because it changes all the time, but the third dip is very interesting!</li>
<li>"Regarding sleep quality, <b>people who might be experiencing sleep disturbance score 8 or higher on the PSQI [4].</b> A visual comparison of participants’ temperature differences and PSQI scores suggests that there is no correlation between sleep/awake temperature difference and sleep quality"</li>
<li>"<b>It can be observed that sleep occurred when temperature was elevated and temperature remains relatively stable throughout sleep.</b> The wrist temperature started to rise at different time for the late and early participants. For the late sleeper, onset was around 10:10 PM, while the onset for the early sleep occurred at around 8:10 PM. In addition, both participants’ <b>wrist temperature patterns show a less-smooth temperature increase when they went to sleep late</b>."</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image028.png" height="350"> → linear correlation between time of temperature onset and sleep onset: the later the temperature onset, later will be the sleep onset.</li>
<li>ME: Conclusion: temperature is undoutedly the most useful sensor for circadian rhythm analysis and prediction.</li>

<ul>
<li>"The measurement errors from the two methods are not positively correlated; they may even (ideally) be negatively correlated [7]. At lower levels of intensity, heart rate is less accurate at estimating energy expenditure; this is the level that accelerometers generally have low error. Conversely, activities performed at moderate-to-vigorous intensity, especially biomechanically diverse activities, are assessed with great uncertainty with accelerometry but are measured well with heart rate monitoring. Activities not measured well by waist-mounted accelerometers such as cycling, walking on incline, carrying weights and activities involving predominantly upper-body work are also captured by heart rate monitoring [6, 27]." <a href="https://dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/physical-activity/objective-methods/combined-sensors" title="https://dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/physical-activity/objective-methods/combined-sensors" class="https">https://dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/physical-activity/objective-methods/combined-sensors</a></li>

<li>250 Hz sampling frequency is considered low, so need much higher! Should be minimum 500 Hz based on guidelines, and provide raw data!</li>
<li>"I also suggest to not rely on any device that automatically gives you HRV analyses. Instead, process and edit your recorded signal in some well known and easy to use software such as Kubios and ARTiiFACT and then work on the HRV indexes. Also, pay attention to the sampling rate of the portable device that shouldn't be less than 500 Hz based on the guidelines."</li>
<li>"For analysis, try Kubios: <a href="http://www.kubios.com" title="http://www.kubios.com" class="http">http://www.kubios.com</a>. Their software is fairly easy to use, and not too expensive. Kubios' limitation is that it doesn't allow you analyze movement or respiration data, it just does HRV. Many people use Kubios for their HRV analysis and process their movement and respiration recordings in Matlab. There are other programs out there that do it all, but they a significantly more expensive."</li>

</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<b>Actigraphy captures 30 discrete types of raw data and yields accurate and validated outcomes across the five standard measures of sleep continuity</b> (the speed at which sleep is initiated and the degree to which sleep is consolidated ): SL (sleep latency), FNA (frequency of nocturnal; awakenings), WASO (total time awake after sleep onset), TST (total sleep time) and SE (sleep efficiency). These five measures are standard metrics in sleep medicine. <br>
<b>The algorithms underpinning the analysis of the raw data of commercial wearable sleep trackers are proprietary and have not been made publicly available.</b> So <b>it is not possible to ascertain their validity</b>. The <b>lack of transparency of the algorithms</b> used by such devices, the limited sampling rate in comparison to actigraphy (10 times less sensitive than actigraphy), and the absence of validation against the gold standard of sleep measurement (polysomnography), suggests that the claims of commercially available devices that they can measure sleep, are questionable."

Orthosomnia refers to sleep problems experienced by those who are preoccupied with perfecting their wearable sleep data. Over time, such a detailed and persistent focus on improving the data obtained from sleep trackers, creates an unhealthy anxiety about sleep which can lead to worse sleep: the opposite of what the users of these devices are presumably seeking. In some cases, a mild sleep problem has been made worse by the use of sleep trackers, whereas in others, normal, healthy sleep has deteriorated due to this technology. <br>
We are likely to see more people presenting with self-generated sleep problems as a result of using wearable sleep trackers that cannot accurately discriminate stages of sleep and are poor at detecting periods of wakefulness after sleep onset. That the algorithms used for data analysis are not available for scrutiny and have not been validated against polysomnography, means that we cannot recommend the use of sleep trackers.<br>

<li>"Some of the smart devices use photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology used by conventional pulse oximeters to measure heartbeat.

<li>"The Zio Patch has shown a higher arrhythmia detection rate when compared to 24-hour Holter (96 vs 61 arrhythmic events; P&lt;0.001).3 Also, the results of the Early Prolonged Ambulatory Cardiac Monitoring in Stroke (EPACS) study, comparing the Zio Patch with 24-hour Holter monitoring in cryptogenic stroke patients, were recently presented at the 3rd European Stroke Organisation Conference (ESOC) 2017. Teo et al showed that AF was detected in 16.3% of patients in the patch group compared with only 2.1% in the standard Holter group (odds ratio of 8.9 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.0; P=0.047).4 The Zio XT, MCOT Patch™, ePatch™, and SEEQ MCT are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Zio XT, ePatch™ and SEEQ MCT have received the CE Mark for use in the European Union."</li>

Equipped with powerful sensors that record 20 million data points, the device is worn as a chest strap, with no wires and no need for patches or gel. It is a three-lead wireless continuous EKG monitor with Bluetooth transmission of data to a smartphone/watch app (iOS only), which can be viewed and analyzed in real time by the user or their doctor.

<li>"Due to lack of substantial evidence showing the overall clinical benefit of these new devices, Holter monitors, event monitors, and implantable loop recorders continue to remain the gold standard for diagnosis of arrhythmias."</li>
<li>"More recently, technological advancements have allowed users to generate rhythm strips from their smartphones or smartwatches. This system uses an external case (that acts as electrodes when touched by the right or left hand of the user) and a downloadable application on a smartphone, which together form an “event monitor.” The cardiac electrical signal is converted to an ultrasound FM sound signal, and the application in the smartphone then demodulates the signal to a digital EKG tracing. The EKG is generated in real time, and can be stored and instantaneously transmitted by the phone to a secure server for further analysis.</li>

The first product of its kind is the KardiaMobile case or card (AliveCor), which consists of two metal electrodes on the back of a case that clips on or attaches to a smartphone. Following its FDA 510(k) approval in 2012, the device became available for prescription in 2013, and received over-the-counter approval in 2014 as a single-channel ECG recorder.6 The technology has demonstrated a sensitivity of 94-100% and a specificity of 91-95% for detecting atrial fibrillation, and has proven to be a simple and cost-effective method of screening for this arrhythmia.7,8 The utility of this device system has been studied in varied clinical settings.9,10" <a href="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" title="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" class="https">https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review</a>

<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>BEST: difference between continuous ECG monitoring and on-touch ECG monitors such as KardiaMobile: "However, this device system has its own limitations like AliveCor. Tracings tend to have more baseline artifacts than standard 12-lead EKGs, making accurate recording and documentation of ventricular rhythms such as monomorphic VT or polymorphic VT very difficult at times.12 <b>Another limitation of such device systems is that the patient must be able to activate the smartphone for an event to be recorded. Therefore, its utility in patients with very transient symptoms is questionable.</b> Implantable loop recorders or event monitors remain the gold standard in such cases."</li>
<li>Can still be useful for atrial fibrillation detection: "AF screening using frequent intermittent short EKG recordings at home has shown increased sensitivity for AF detection (STROKESTOP study).13 Therefore, these smartphone event monitors can prove to be very convenient, effective, and user-friendly tools for AF screening in the future."</li>
<li><b>BEST: PPG with smartphone app using camera and LED is clinically reliable enough to detect some heart issues!</b> "Several downloadable applications have been developed (both for iOS and Android users) for smartphones that use PPG-based algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation or normal sinus rhythm. These applications do not require external hardware, and use only the phone’s camera and light. The user puts his right index or second finger on the sensor, and the signal recorded is then processed through an app with built-in algorithms for AF detection. McManus et al demonstrated excellent specificity (0.975), sensitivity (0.962), and accuracy (0.968) using an iPhone 4S camera and algorithm.14 Chan et al also compared the Cardiio Rhythm smartphone PPG application with the AliveCor automated algorithm, and found a sensitivity of 92.9% for PPG technology (higher than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm) as well as a specificity of 97.7% for PPG technology (comparable with AliveCor). However, the positive predictive value of PPG technology was lower (53.1% vs 76.9%) than the AliveCor automated algorithm.15 The PPG technology also has its own limitations; for example, it cannot differentiate between frequent atrial premature beats or atrial arrhythmias, which may lead to false diagnoses of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, in 2016, McManus et al demonstrated that an enhanced smartphone app could accurately discriminate pulse recordings during AF from sinus rhythm, premature atrial contractions (accuracy of 0.955), and premature ventricular contractions (accuracy of 0.960).16" → Apps: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27444506/" title="Cardiio Rhythm" class="https">Cardiio Rhythm</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26391728/" title="PULSE-SMART" class="https">PULSE-SMART</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3698570/" title="Unnamed custom McManus's app" class="https">Unnamed custom McManus's app</a></li>
<li>Limitations of PPG measures analyzed with DNN such as in the Apple Watch: "PPG-based technology has been extended to wearables such as smartwatches. A recent poster presentation at HRS 2017 by Sanchez et al showed that the Cardiogram app for the Apple Watch accurately distinguished pulse recordings during AF from those obtained during normal sinus rhythm (using deep neural network [DNN] based algorithms).17 Oster and Clifford reported that <b>AF detection accuracies of PPG-based technology using DNN algorithms rapidly declines to 70-80% with the addition of typical amounts of noise observed in the real ambulatory settings</b>.18 However, Shashikumar et al proposed a new model using the Simband (Samsung),19 in which they applied a continuous wavelet transform to the PPG data, and a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm was derived to detect AF. Combining the output of the CNN with features calculated based on beat-to beat variability and signal quality significantly improved AF detection accuracy, and also provided additional discriminatory power to DNN algorithms to separate out noise from AF data.20"</li>
<li>Future technologies: Earlobe PPG sensor, skin patch with no battery (using body's energy?)</li>
<li>"Smartphone monitors and patches have the potential to replace traditional event and Holter monitors for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, PPG-based AF detection can serve as excellent screening tools. However, these device systems and apps need to be further validated in larger randomized studies in order for wide acceptance among physicians. For now, their use is mostly limited to screening for arrhythmias (such as AF) in apparently healthy individuals."</li>

<li>"Le Smartphone se trouve ainsi doté d’une fonction de pulsomètre et le signal est affiché sous forme d’un « pseudo électrocardiogramme ».  Mais attention il ne s’agit que des indications du passage du sang au niveau alors qu’aucun signal électrique n’est enregistré. Cela ne reflète donc pas l’activité électrique du coeur, celle que l’on cherche à analyser en cas de troubles du rythme cardiaque. Ces applications sont donc peu fiables. De plus des artéfacts liés au mouvement du doigt appliqué contre la source de lecture peuvent être faussement interprétés comme des arythmies. Par ailleurs, des extrasystoles, ne générant pas un pouls efficace, ne seront pas visualisées par cette méthode. Au total, il ne faut pas utiliser ces applicatifs dans un but médical."</li>

<ul>
<li>Ambulatory ECG = AECG: "The rhythm information derived from the large variety of <b>AECG recording systems can often lead to appropriate and patient-specific medical and interventional management</b>."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"<b>Ideally, all AECG devices should use the classic 12-lead electrocardiographic architecture.</b> However, because of technological and financial issues, <b>only a minority of AECG monitors have 12-lead capability</b>."</li>
<li>"As the above-mentioned consensus document also points out, many AECGs use EASI reduced-lead systems, as an alternative to both the commonly used 5-electrode monitoring system and the traditional 12-lead ECG monitoring devices. The EASI 12-lead ECG is derived from a set of four recording electrodes and one reference electrode. It uses the E, A, and I electrodes from the Frank lead system and adds an ‘S’ electrode at the top of the mid sternum, along with a body reference electrode to provide orthogonally oriented signals.2" → 5-lead EASI = 12-lead ECG reconstructed orthogonally (as <a href="https://medium.com/@timofeilipsky/single-lead-ecg-informativity-for-wearable-application-5dc24b13881c" title="explained here" class="https">explained here</a>)</li>
<li>"An AECG recorded with torso placement of the extremity electrodes cannot be considered equivalent to the standard ECG for all purposes, and should not be used interchangeably with a standard ECG for serial comparison."</li>
<li>"It is obvious that recorders using only one or a limited number of leads are not able to reliably record any episodes of ischaemia with accompanying ST-segment changes. All previous recorders, either external or implantable, have contributed excellent diagnostic services in the investigation of episodes of paroxysmal arrhythmia or unexplained syncope. Wearable ECG monitoring patches using two closely spaced electrodes, provide 1- or 2-lead recordings, for several days, thus increasing the diagnostic yield of arrhythmia detection. However, the performance of single-lead devices is limited by the lower voltage amplitude of the recorded ECG, thus impairing accurate recognition of the arrhythmia type and origin. In the same context, external loop recorders record a single-lead ECG without providing information on the precise orientation of P, QRS, and T waves as well as on changes of ST segment.1"</li>
<li>artifacts in ECG: "Here, we can distinguish two main categories that lead to more or less the same problem. The first category relates to body movements, appropriate skin preparation for skin electrode placement and, more generally, the functionality of the electrodes. All of the above are capable of generating deviations that make interpretation difficult, while these artefacts are not infrequently perceived incorrectly as arrhythmias. The second category of artefacts is associated with deficient contact between the electrodes and the skin. Bad skin–electrode contact is quite likely to cause pseudopauses to appear on the recording, while pacemaker spikes may disappear. Larger portions of an ECG, such as the QRS complex, are also often distorted.4,5"</li>
<li>Holter is not perfect either: "Of course, this older modality, which is traditionally called Holter monitoring, cannot reliably detect a large percentage of paroxysmal events associated with either arrhythmias or myocardial ischaemia, since their detection requires a longer period of recording and/or a higher resolution tracing.6,7"</li>
<li>"It is also important to note that supraventricular arrhythmias, which are based on atrial activity, or arrhythmological problems associated with the length of the PQ or QT interval, are often not detected by recordings that use a limited number of electrodes.8,9"</li>
<li>"The <b>majority of ischaemic attacks</b>—especially in certain categories of patient, such as <b>diabetics</b>—are known to occur without pain, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, and the reliable recording of ST changes would of course be particularly useful if they were associated with only mild or atypical symptoms. Unfortunately, continuous electrocardiographic monitoring equipment that has <b>only one, three or five ECG leads usually proves insufficient and is not very reliable when it comes to ST-segment changes</b>."</li>
<li>"Wearable AECG monitoring devices capable of continuous recording for two or more weeks, with 12 or 15 leads, will contribute decisively to the diagnostic possibilities in patients with paroxysmal heart episodes of arrhythmia and/or ischaemia."</li>
<li>SUMMARY: single-lead sufficient for arrhythmias detection, but 12-leads minimum necessary for ischemia (useful for diabetics) but 15-leads is preferable (even with 15-leads, only 58% chance of detecting some kinds of ischemia!). 5-leads not enough for ischemia. But EASI 5-electrodes = 12-leads ECG, so maybe this is sufficient? - combined with fibricheck's existence, so a single-lead ECG can detect both arrhythmias and fibrial atrillation, but not ischemias.</li>

<ul>
<li>BEST: "Evaluation of the ECG recordings was performed with NevroEKG software (Jožef Stefan Institute, Clinical Centre Ljubljana). The software can also extract the respiration rate based on the amplitude changes of QRS complexes [15]."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "The system used in this report has no wires, smaller number of electrodes, and the ability to synthesize the multi-lead ECG [20, 21, 23]. The NevroEKG software enables quick and easy analysis of instantaneous heart rate and rhythm, as well as average heart rate during sampled periods. Additionally, the NevroEKG enables good overview of the recording so that any changes of the rhythm, heart rate or duration of the waves can be promptly noticed, even if the arrhythmias are intermittent [2, 16]." — refs 20 and 21 are amazing!!!
<ul>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: Synthesis of the 12-lead Electrocardiogram From Differential Leads, Trobec &amp; Tomasic, 2011 </b><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21768013/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21768013/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21768013/</a> — <b>12-leads ECG reconstructed from only 3-leads ECG that are proximal! And with accuracy outperforming EASI 5-lead to 12-lead ECG!</b>
<ul>
<li>"To determine the optimal number of differential leads, the syntheses for two, three, and four differential leads were calculated. <b>The analysis shows that 3 is the optimal number of differential leads for practical applications. Because of the proximity of the differential electrodes, the proposed approach offers an opportunity for the synthesis of a standard 12-lead ECG with wireless electrodes.</b>"</li>
<li>"The algorithm has been evaluated on ninety-nine multichannel ECGs measured on thirty healthy subjects and thirty-five patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery. It is shown that the algorithm significantly outperforms the synthesis based on the EASI lead system with medians of correlation coefficients greater than 0.954 for all twelve standard leads."</li>
<li>"The conventional 12-lead ECG is obtained from <b>ten electrodes</b> placed strategically on the patient's body."</li>
<li>"Possibly the most promising type of wearable ECG device is that using wireless electrodes (WEs) [2], [3] that enables the minimal use of wires on the body and consequently maximal wearing comfort. A WE enables the measurement and transmission of only local potential differences, i.e. bipolar measurements, from two closely placed skin electrodes. A number of WEs can constitute a body wireless sensor network (BWSN), eliminating the need for additional wires and therefore improving their applicability [2]. The measurements thus form a limited lead system that can potentially be used for reconstruction of the 12-lead ECG."</li>
<li>"Existing limited lead systems [4] can be divided into two groups – lead systems that use a subset of the 12-lead ECG set of leads, and systems that use special leads. The most widely studied limited lead system is the <b>EASI system [5], which is commercially available from Philips Medical Systems</b>. In this system, <b>four special electrodes and a single ground electrode</b> are applied at predefined positions on the body surface. Another device that also exploits predefined positioning is the trans-telephonic system [6] that measures lead “I” from the standard 12-lead ECG plus two special bipolar leads. A further promising lead system is “eigenleads” [7], which is closely related to the development of smart textiles [8] and enables bipolar lead measurements acquired from distant recording sites on the body surface. Even though there have been attempts to use neural networks for synthesis of the 12-lead ECG [9], the predominant strategy is to estimate a transformation matrix [10] that can be universal, i.e. applicable to every person, or personalized."</li>
<li>BEST: free placement of electrodes opens lots of new possibilities: "In order to obtain the best synthesis, positions and transformation matrices both have to be personalized, since every human body is unique. <b>One of the advantages of WEs is that their positions can be completely arbitrary</b>, which enables maximal personalization of the recording sites." — WE = wireless electrode</li>
<li>"Although not attempting to synthesize a 12-lead ECG, those studies showed that <b>Signal/Noise is acceptable for all bipolar leads measured at an inter-electrode distance of at least 5cm</b>."</li>
<li>"We have demonstrated that just <b>three WEs suffice for the reliable synthesis of the 12-lead ECG</b>. This result confirms the assumption that <b>a single fixed-location dipole provides an adequate representation of a heart’s electrical activity</b>."</li>

<ul>
<li>"The presented theoretical and experimental justifications for the synthesis show that it is not necessary to measure a large number of leads directly, because the standard 12-lead ECG and arbitrary additional leads can be synthesized. Various approaches to evaluating the synthesized 12-lead ECG are defined and explained, and a number of systems that synthesize 12-lead ECG are presented as they were introduced in the literature. We cover the developments and improvements from the 1940s to the present day. The systems are classified on the basis of the synthesis method used, the approach to the evaluation of the synthesized ECG (depending on the measurement sites used), and on the number and types of leads employed."</li>
<li>"The leads of such a device do not have to be a subset of the standard 12-lead ECG. Furthermore, there are systems that employ more than eight leads, with <b>some of them having more than 100 leads</b>. ECGs produced by systems that employ more than 24 leads are referred to as multichannel ECGs (MECGs)."</li>
<li>reduced-lead sets (same placement as 12-lead ECG but with less leads) vs special leads (custom placement): "The systems with reduced numbers of leads that synthesize a 12-lead ECG are often called <b>“derived 12-lead ECG systems”</b> [4]. These systems can be divided into two classes: systems that employ subsets of the leads from a 12-lead ECG, referred to as “reduced-lead sets” [4], and systems that use special leads."</li>
<li>"Since 1968, many derived 12-lead ECG systems have been investigated. Only recently, however, novel measurement technologies and systems have emerged that significantly improve the acquisition of ECG recordings and the quality of the synthesized 12-lead ECG. The electrode positions are selected in such a way that they acquire the maximum amount of “information” about the heart’s electrical activity."</li>
<li>"The main aim of all new devices is to acquire the maximum amount of information about the heart’s electrical activity while using the minimum number of electrodes [7]."</li>
<li>"As most electrocardiographic diagnostic knowledge has been accumulated and described mainly on the basis of the 12-lead ECG, it is useful for any system with a reduced number of leads to be able to synthesize a 12-lead ECG."</li>
<li>"Even though there have been attempts to use neural networks for the purpose of this synthesis [8], <b>the most common strategy is to construct a linear transformation [9] (most often described as a matrix) that can be universal, i.e., applicable to any person, or personalized</b>."</li>
<li>"Therefore, the 12-lead ECG system has eight truly independent and four redundant leads. The basic idea behind all derived 12-lead ECG systems is thus to synthesize the 12-lead ECG from less than eight independent leads." — hence why D-Heart has a 8-leads mode!</li>
<li>"an understanding developed that although electrode systems might look orthogonal, this does not necessarily imply the mutual orthogonality of the lead vectors [18]. Such systems that were not measuring leads with lead vectors in precisely orthogonal directions, and of the same length, are referred to as “uncorrected orthogonal lead systems.” The most important step that advanced the assessment of electrocardiographic leads was the Frank image space [17]."</li>
<li>"Compared with the majority of other derived 12-lead ECG systems, the EASI system is less sensitive to artifacts that are a consequence of body movement, since the measurement sites are located exclusively on the torso. Accurate positioning of the electrodes is relatively easy since the recording locations are at prominent anatomical landmarks."</li>
<li>"The detection efficiencies of the EASI system were found to be equivalent to the standard 12-lead ECG for the detection of acute ischemia [76]–[80], acute MI [81], and prior MI [74], [76], [78], [82]."</li>
<li>"On the basis of all the tests, the authors concluded that the synthesized 12-lead ECG is, in general, very accurate, while being slightly sensitive to small positional variations of the mobile device. More importantly, they note that the observed errors in the synthesized 12-lead ECG are not diagnostically significant."</li>
<li>"Another promising lead system with special leads is closely related to the development of smart textiles [86]. Smart textiles integrate the measurement devices, wires, and electrodes into clothing, thereby enabling the convenient acquisition of ECG recordings. A drawback of these devices is that the measurements obtained are susceptible to noise and artifacts caused by the movement of the electrodes. The lead system named “Eigenleads” [66] attempts to resolve the imperfections in smart textiles by employing principal component analysis, a multivariate statistical technique, to identify the measurement sites at which the signal-to-noise ratio is a maximum."</li>
<li>BEST SUMMARY: "The systems with reduced numbers of leads employ universal or personalized synthesis, but all use universal measurement sites (i.e., universal electrode positions). The only exception is the system of DLs that enables person-specific WE positions. <b>The systems of DLs and of eigenleads are the only two that make use of a statistical method for deriving the electrode positions. All the other systems presented use a subset of the conventional 12-lead ECG lead set, or attempt to guess the optimum electrode positions by seeking to make leads orthogonal and less susceptible to electrode misplacement, and/or seeking to make the system as easy to use as possible.</b>" — in other words, only derived-leads (DL) systems and eigenleads have a strong statistical foundation!</li>
<li>BEST METHOD: how the universal transform matrix is usually calculated: "<b>The 12-lead ECG and the leads used for the synthesis are simultaneously measured on each person.</b> Equally long segments, or average beats, from the measurements taken from different persons are <b>concatenated to form all-embracing measurements that are used as the inputs for the linear-regression algorithm</b>, which results in a linear transformation that is potentially applicable to every person. The obtained measurements can also be used for training the ANN, which results in a universal ANN that can be used to synthesize a 12-lead ECG that is applicable for every person. There are two further methods of universal synthesis, but they are only applicable in combination with linear regression. One is to form the universal transformation coefficients as the mean of the transformation coefficients obtained for each person. The other method is a generalization of the search method. <b>Instead of assuming the best combination of parameters to be the one that produces the best synthesized ECG for a particular person, the chosen coefficients are those that result in the best synthesis, on average, over all the considered measurements.</b>"</li>

However, a more detailed study would be needed in order to investigate the ability of this method to identify critical conditions for vulnerable subjects."</li>
<li>"A wearable ECG patch contains wireless <b>Short Distance Bipolar Electrodes (SDBE)</b> which measure the ECG signal from two closely placed skin electrodes. Previous studies investigated the optimal location and intra electrode distance for such a patch [6],[7]. These studies showed that a <b>5cm distance between electrodes provided acceptable signal-to-noise ratio</b>."</li>
<li>"However, these studies did not consider the synthesis of ECG from separate patches, which introduces many challenges that are not covered by acquiring ECG from body potential maps. These include the fact that the <b>separate patches are not normally connected to a common reference, and can have issues with synchronization</b>. In addition to that, patches normally have a battery which poses limits on both recording time and sampling rates used. The aim of this study is to investigate the synthesis of a 3-lead ECG from 3 separate wireless patches using a linear reconstruction method. Positive results would confirm the applicability of the methodology to real home-monitoring situations."</li>
<li>BEST METHOD: needs a 12-lead ECG to calibrate but after it's fine: "For data processing purposes, MATLAB (MathWorks Inc.) was used. Each signal was filtered (3rd order Butterworth filter, bandwidth 0.1-40 Hz). Signals from the patches were then down-sampled to 100 Hz in order to have all data at the same sampling frequency. The signals were then manually synchronized and segmented in two parts: the first 10% was used to derive a linear relationship between the standard ECG and the data from the patches; the rest 90% was used for quality evaluation. Using linear regression, the standard ECG constitutes the target for the synthesis, as following: Where ECGk indicates the k lead from the standard ECG; Cross-correlation [%] indicates the error; i indicates the signal from patch i, indicates the coefficient for patch i and it is estimated using the least-squares method for every lead k."</li>

<li>"Sweat is a largely unexplored biofluid that contains many important biomarkers ranging from electrolytes and metabolites to proteins, cytokines, antigens, and exogenous drugs. The eccrine and apocrine glands produce and excrete sweat through microscale pores on the epidermal surface, offering a noninvasive means for capturing and probing biomarkers that reflect hydration state, fatigue, nutrition, and physiological changes. Recent advances in skin-interfaced wearable sensors capable of real-time in situ sweat collection and analytics provide capabilities for continuous biochemical monitoring in an ambulatory mode of operation."</li>
<li>"A resulting surge in academic and industrial research in this area aimed at tracking body movements (7, 8), temperature (9, 10), cardiac activity [electrocardiography, ECG (11, 12)], brain processes [electroencephalography, EEG (13)], muscle contractions [electromyography, EMG (14, 15)], electrical and thermal properties (16), hemodynamics (17, 18), blood pressure (12), and others. Although these biophysical parameters provide invaluable insights into physiological status, <b>they lack direct information on dynamic biochemical and metabolic processes</b>."</li>

<li>BEST: Sleep stages prediction with actigraphy using an Apple Watch (Series 2 and 3), with a publicly disclosed method: Sleep stage prediction with raw acceleration and photoplethysmography heart rate data derived from a consumer wearable device, 2019 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/12/zsz180/5549536" title="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/12/zsz180/5549536" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/42/12/zsz180/5549536</a>

<li>"This study demonstrates, for the first time, the ability to analyze raw acceleration and heart rate data from a ubiquitous wearable device with accepted, disclosed mathematical methods to improve accuracy of sleep and sleep stage prediction."</li>

<li>Apple Watch has a 50 Hz sampling rate for accelerometer/actigraphy, quite good! Just half of AX3! "In general, data were sampled at approximately 50 Hz, with two exceptions: (1) motion was sampled at 20 Hz for the first two subjects due to battery life concerns and (2) occasionally, short windows of time with missing data would occur, likely due to server-side issues during the real-time sleep night data collection. Less than 3% of the total recording time was affected in this way, and interpolation was used to estimate counts during missing time points."</li>
<li>PPG sampling rate is much worse: "Heart rate was measured by PPG from the Apple Watch and returned in beats per minute sampled every several seconds. This signal was interpolated to have a value for every 1 second, smoothed and filtered to amplify periods of high change by convolving with a difference of Gaussians filter (σ 1 = 120 seconds, σ 2 = 600 seconds)."</li>
<li>Very interesting "clock proxy" analysis, using steps and activity profiling as a proxy of the subject's circadian rhythm instead of light as is done usually in models (and likely temperature would be even better). Original model accounting for light: A simple model of the humancircadian pacemaker, 1999: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10643750/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10643750/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10643750/</a></li>
<li><b>BEST: review by Czeisler of this model and others, using core body temperature</b> to estimate the underlying circadian rhythm! Predicts intermittent pulse light as effective for circadian rhythm shifting + internal stiffness parameter (difficult to discriminate between low and high, maybe there are both in humans?) + predicted that light exposure would be heightened in the evening during phase delay part of the PRC: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/074873099129000876" title="https://doi.org/10.1177/074873099129000876" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1177/074873099129000876</a>
<ul>
<li>"Close examination of the figures in Patricia DeCoursey’s (1959) thesis from the University of Wisconsin, in which she described for the first time the PRC to light for a mammal, reveals that <b>each time she administered a light pulse that elicited a shift of circadian phase in the flying squirrel, she also elicited a change in circadian period.</b>" → circadian plasticity. But it's temporary, no memory, hence it's short-term plasticity, not long-term.</li>
<li>"In the present volume, Beersma et al. formalize these observations into the concept of a <b>period response curve</b> (Beersma et al., 1999). [...] In addition to the conventional effects of light in shifting phase, they allow light to change the intrinsic period of the circadian pacemaker. Their simulation results suggest that the combined effect of change in phase and a change in period allow a more precise timing of the circadian pacemaker to events in the outside world."</li>
<li>"Likewise, since changes in phase are automatically associated with the changes in period, the notion of changing period and phase is an intrinsic part of these current dynamic models of the human circadian pacemaker. The work of Beersma and colleagues suggests that building models in which these two variables may change independently will increase the dynamic adaptation of the pacemaker to the external environment (Beersma et al., 1999). Their work poses the interesting question of whether adapting current models that implicitly define the relations between changes in phase and changes in period will yield better descriptions of the human circadian system and its adaptation to light or whether new models should be entertained in which the dynamics of the period change and dynamics of the phase change can be manipulated independently. Further study will be required to resolve this issue."</li>

<li>"Circadian rhythms become less dominant and less regular with chronic-degenerative disease, such that to accurately assess these pathological conditions it is important to quantify not only periodic characteristics but also more irregular aspects of the corresponding time series. Novel data-adaptive techniques, such as <b>singular spectrum analysis (SSA)</b>, allow for the decomposition of experimental time series, in <b>a model-free way, into a trend, quasiperiodic components and noise fluctuations</b>. We compared SSA with the traditional techniques of cosinor analysis and intradaily variability using 1-week continuous actigraphy data in young adults with acute insomnia and healthy age-matched controls. The findings suggest a small but significant delay in circadian components in the subjects with acute insomnia, i.e. a larger acrophase, and alterations in the day-to-day variability of acrophase and amplitude. The power of the ultradian components follows a fractal 1/f power law for controls, whereas for those with acute insomnia this power law breaks down because of an increased variability at the 90min time scale, reminiscent of Kleitman’s basic rest-activity (BRAC) cycles. This suggests that for healthy sleepers attention and activity can be sustained at whatever time scale required by circumstances, whereas for those with acute insomnia this capacity may be impaired and these individuals need to rest or switch activities in order to stay focused. Traditional methods of circadian rhythm analysis are unable to detect the more subtle effects of day-to-day variability and ultradian rhythm fragmentation at the specific 90min time scale."</li>

<li>"The traditional method to analyse circadian rhythms is cosinor analysis, which quantifies the 24-hour (24h), and other periodic cycles, by means of examining the degree of “fit” between the data and a user-defined model consisting of a superposition of cosine functions [21, 22]. However, experimental data where the statistical properties vary over time (non-stationary data), such as having a dominant trend [23–25], or time-varying amplitudes, frequencies or phases [26–28], are much harder or impossible to describe using models based on these periodic functions. Another disadvantage of the cosinor method is that it is unable to detect rhythm fragmentation. With this in mind, the traditional approach, particularly for the analysis of actigraphy data, has been the measure of intradaily variability (IV), which is not model-based and hence is a nonparametric method. IV quantifies the frequency and the importance of transitions between periods of rest and activity, and for historical reasons is generally applied to hourly clustered data [2, 29, 30]. Although qualitatively different, the cosinor method and the IV method can be seen as complementary, where the focus of the former is the characterization of the 24h periodic aspects of the data, whereas the latter assesses the degree of rhythm fragmentation. Recently, more specialized techniques have been developed to study circadian rhythms (see Ref. [31] for a review). In particular, wavelets have been used to study circadian rhythms of nonstationary data [27, 28]. Wavelets however are, as with cosinor analysis, model based in the sense that the results obtained may depend on the particular wavelet basis function selected by the user. While continuous wavelet transforms may need an explicit prior detrending, discrete wavelet transforms are more effective in extracting time series components." → review of methods to model the circadian rhythm from actigraphy data: Procedures for numerical analysis of circadian rhythms, 2007: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23710111" title="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23710111" class="http">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23710111</a></li>

<li>"Polysomnography (PSG) is the current gold standard in high-resolution sleep monitoring; however, this method is obtrusive, expensive, and time-consuming. Conversely, commercially available wrist monitors such as <b>ActiWatch can monitor sleep for multiple days and at low cost, but often overestimate sleep and cannot differentiate between sleep stages</b>, such as rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM. Wireless wearable sensors are a promising alternative for their portability and access to high-resolution data for customizable analytics. We present <b>a multimodal sensor system measuring hand acceleration, electrocardiography, and distal skin temperature that outperforms the ActiWatch, detecting wake and sleep with a recall of 74.4% and 90.0%, respectively, as well as wake, non-REM, and REM with recall of 73.3%, 59.0%, and 56.0%, respectively.</b> This approach will enable clinicians and researchers to more easily, accurately, and inexpensively assess long-term sleep patterns, diagnose sleep disorders, and monitor risk factors for disease in both laboratory and home settings."</li>

<ul>
<li>"both devices displayed <b>very high validity correlation with the reference thermometer (r &gt; 0.999)</b>. Prior to correction, the <b>mean bias was +0.121 ◦C for iButtons</b> and +0.045 ◦C for thermistors. Upon calibration correction the mean bias for iButtons and thermistors was not significantly different from zero bias. Interestingly, <b>the typical error of the estimate of iButtons (0.043 ◦C) was 1.5 times less than that of thermistors (0.062 ◦C), demonstrating iButtons lower random error</b>."</li>
<li>"however, <b>thermistor responses gave readings that were always closer to ambient temperature than those given by iButtons , suggesting potential thermistor drift towards environmental conditions.</b>" → BEST: thermistors used in AX3 and AX6 thus are more reliably reflecting ambient temperature than skin temperature, so they are good sensors for ambient temperature even when worn at the same body site as the iButton.</li>
<li>"The device examined in the present study is the latest highcapacity model of wireless Thermochron iButton data logger (<b>DS1922L</b>: figure 1). The iButtonR devices were originally designed to monitor temperature-sensitive consignments during transport and have been utilized in relatively few scientific studies."</li>
<li>"The manufacturer’s specifications for the DS1922L state that this latest model will now function <b>throughout the full human thermo-physiological range</b>. DS1922L provides digitized readouts, with <b>a user-determined resolution</b>, set at the time of programming the devices, <b>of either 0.5 ◦C or 0.0625 ◦C</b>."</li>
<li>"Currently, the only foreseeable <b>disadvantage with the iButton system is that temperature readings can only be viewed once the device has finished logging data</b>." → so wireless iButton means that we don't need to be connected during logging, but it doesn't mean that the transfer can be done wirelessly unfortunately...</li>
<li>"This evidence indicates that iButtonsR could be particularly valuable with regard to the continuous monitoring of Tsk under free-living and ambulatory conditions (Rutkove et al 2007), with relevance in many scientific fields, including environmental physiology, exercise physiology, <b>sleep and circadian rhythm research</b> (Lichtenbelt et al 2006)." — Tsk = Temperature of skin</li>
<li>"Furthermore, iButtonsR may be viable for the Tsk monitoring of clinical populations, as certain patient groups do not comply well with the extensive wiring associated with skin thermocouples and thermistors, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s dementia or Parkinson’s disease as well as pediatric groups (Lichtenbelt et al 2006). The iButtonR method may also prove valuable to the medical field for peri-operative temperature monitoring (Rajek et al 1999). iButtonsR are easy to sterilize and they are wireless, both attributes being advantageous for surgical applications, as they would not hinder the surgical procedure (Rajek et al 1999)."</li>
<li>"To our knowledge, there has been only one previous study which attempted to provide a preliminary evaluation of an earlier iButtonR model for scientific research on humans (Lichtenbelt et al 2006). This older model of iButtonR did not function through the full human thermo-physiological range however, and the evaluation (Lichtenbelt et al 2006) did not include a full battery of validity statistics nor were comparative assessments during exercise included."</li>
<li>"Trials began with participants applying a rectal thermistor probe (YSI Series 400, Henley Medical Supplies Ltd, Herts., UK), in privacy, 10 cm beyond the external anal sphincter in order to monitor rectal core temperature continuously under all conditions, purely as a safety precaution."</li>
<li>"The iButtonsR and thermistors were affixed to the skin using the same strip of adhesive, water-resistant, medical-grade tape (Hypafix, BSN Medical GmbH, Hamburg, Germany), with a separation of approximately 1 cm. An additional strip of tape was placed directly below the thermistors’ sensor heads, attaching 5 cm of wiring from each thermistor to the skin at each site. This precaution was taken to try to minimize movement of the thermistors and ideally prevent detachment. In accordance with ISO-standard 9886 (2004), mean Tsk was measured at 14 equally weighted body locations under the passive, seated exposure conditions, as represented by the following equation"</li>
<li>body sites for measurement of Tsk (skin temperature) on page 100, both at rest and exercise (different sites). Forehead was a site in both.</li>
<li>BEST METHOD: to compare accuracy between one measurement device and a reference device (can be used to compare Greenteg CORE as reference with iButton, to see if iButton is a good proxy - or comparison can be also done on the resulting predicted circadian rhythm, so either on the raw data as is or on the output/goal as done for study on brain temperature): "Proportional error in the data was also examined to verify homoscedasticity, with data treatment and the statistical methods utilized, employed accordingly (Atkinson and Nevill 1998). According to the BSI and ISO, a method is considered to show good repeatability if (I) the agreement with the reference is not significantly different from zero and (II) 95% of the differences observed lie within 1.96 s (the 95% LoA) of the mean difference (Altman and Bland 1983, Bland and Altman 1986, British Standards Institution 1987, Mantha et al 2000). If a method meets these two criteria, it can be considered suitable for interchangeable usage with the reference. However, a more informed decision may be made from a composite assessment of a battery of validity statistics: very low bias, high correlation, low typical error, narrow 95% LoA and a low CV demonstrates good agreement between methods."</li>
<li>"Encouraging though is recent evidence indicating that <b>infrared thermometry may hold promise as a reference method for Tsk measurement</b> (Giansanti and Maccioni 2007)."</li>
<li>" It is also possible that the two devices respond to occlusion by tape differently. However, although <b>occlusion by tape can alter the skin micro-environment and affect heat transfer</b> (Buono and Ulrich 1998), the conditions were the same for both devices, so response differences due to taping are highly unlikely. The iButtons and thermistors were both taped to the skin with the same section of tape and were within 1 cm of one another at each site. Although there has been criticism of utilizing ‘covered’ temperature sensors (Buono and Ulrich 1998), the acrylic rings utilized in previous studies to keep the sensors ‘uncovered’ are no longer commercially available and in manufacturing one’s own replica of these acrylic rings, there is always the risk of a loss of good thermal contact, which is less of a worry with proper taping. To clarify any existing uncertainties as to which measurement technique provides readings closer to a true value, a future study could compare iButtons and thermistors with a device which might perform better during human Tsk applications, such as an infrared thermometer (Giansanti and Maccioni 2007)."</li>
<li>"These findings indicate that wireless iButtonsR provide a valid alternative for Tsk as well as general temperature measurement during laboratory and field investigations particularly when Tsk measurement using other currently available methods may prove problematic."</li>

Sensitivity of the dermal thermometers for detecting core temperatures ≥38.0 °C was low, ranging from 0.33 to 0.6, but improved to 0.60 to 0.80 after adjusting temperatures by the methods' average deviation from rectal temperature. The results from the dermal thermometers tested here showed an insufficient correlation to core temperature to be used for core temperature monitoring in clinical research and practice. Unfortunately, other options for non-invasive temperature measurements are few.

[...] There was a significantly different response of the two sets of iButtons to the gradual temperature increase of the hot plate and the subsequent instant cold exposure. Upon contact with the hot plate, the iButtons with the top side facing the object were significantly warmer for the first 4 min than those with the bottom side against the object (Fig. 3). During exposure to the cold object the ‘top-side’ iButtons were significantly cooler during a 5-min period. We conclude that the top side has a faster response to thermal changes when placed on hard and flat surfaces. The difference between the bottom and top side thermal response may in part have been caused by the locations of the battery (towards the bottom) and the sensor (towards the top)." -- but both sides will eventually reflect the real temperature, but the top side is faster to catch up on sudden temperature changes than the bottom side, likely because the battery may partially insulate.

<li>another confirmation: "Simply touching a 1-Wire® probe to the DS1921H reveals the surrounding temperature in the range of 15–46°C, with an accuracy of ±1°C and resolution of 0.125°C." Current Developments in Wearable Thermometers, 2018 <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" title="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" class="https">https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf</a> — ie, it's the same side to transfer data on the bluedot receiver and to sense temperature.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also tested on 14 body sites on human skin and sudden ambient temperature change: "Thus, the iButtons appear to react slower than thermocouples. The differences were clearly smaller in the hot environment compared to the cold situation. Overall, the mean skin temperature determined using the 14 iButtons differed 0.3 ± 0.65 °C from the temperature determined using the 14 thermocouples. The mean skin temperature estimated using four versus 14 thermocouples according to ISO 9886 revealed a difference of 0.4 °C. This indicates that the difference between iButtons and thermocouples is in the same range as the difference between using four or 14 thermocouples to assess skin temperature. [...] The temperature yielded by the thermocouples was closer to ambient temperature than the iButton temperature (Fig. 4). [...] Thus, the temperature differences between the thermocouples and iButtons are larger soon after ambient condition changes. The thermal inertia delays the response, and errors up to 1 °C may occur under realistic circumstances."</li>
<li>exercise not necessary for circadian rhythm + <b>causal link between core body temperature and circadian rhythm</b>: "<b>The 24-h rhythm in core body temperature is the result of differential 24-h rhythms in heat production and heat loss.</b> It has been demonstrated that under strictly controlled so-called ‘<b>constant routine’</b> conditions, in which subjects remain awake in a fixed semi-supine condition without physical activity and with food and drinks taken in small portions throughout the day and night, the core temperature rhythm remains. Furthermore, <b>the core temperature rhythm has been shown to result mostly from the circadian rhythm in heat loss, and to a lesser extent from changes in heat production [12]. Dry heat loss is caused by increased skin blood flow, allowing the dissipation of heat from the warm blood to the cooler environment.</b> Although the iButton is not suitable for core body temperature assessment in humans, the assessment of temperature at multiple sites of the skin provides a reliable estimate of heat loss [12,13], suggesting a role for the iButton in long-term studies on the circadian variation in skin temperature and heat-loss which is responsible for an important part of the circadian variation in core body temperature."</li>
<li>"The value of skin temperature assessment extends to sleep research, because <b>endogenous skin warming, which results from increased skin blood flow, is functionally linked to sleep propensity</b>. In addition, exogenous skin warming in the thermoneutral, comfortable range has a strong impact on sleep propensity [7,14,15]. Therefore, the feasibility of using multiple iButtons in skin temperature studies on circadian rhythms and sleep performed outside the laboratory was investigated."</li>
<li>Use 2 sensors: proximal AND distal sensors, 2 sensor, and the difference will show when is the circadian rhythm. TODO CRITICAL: find again other study explaining why proximal vs distal explains the circadian rhythm (because of heat evaporation etc): "the distal to proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG) is shown on a separate axis. Note that the marked and simultaneous nocturnal elevation of both proximal and distal temperature hardly ever occurs during wakefulness, indicative of a different thermoregulatory state during the sleep period. Note furthermore the negative correlation between activity level and skin temperatures, which is quite the reverse of the documented positive association of activity level and core body temperature."</li>
<li><b>BEST METHOD: to clean up noise (denoising) of temperature data from home/wild settings, on humans at home and for circadian rhythm prediction:</b> "In contrast to most laboratory assessments, it seldom happens that field assessments are free of artefacts. Therefore an automated artefact rejection procedure was applied to exclude extreme drops and rises in temperature. Because of the bimodal rather than normal distribution of the temperature data, no artefact rejection was applied to exclude data more than two or three standard deviations from the mean, but rather a three-step nonparametric method. [...] the three-step artefact rejection procedure resulted in far fewer noisy distal and proximal curves, whereas the variability was maintained. Firstly, the rate of change (ROC) of all subsequent single channel data points was calculated, their quartiles Q25 and Q75, and their interquartile distance (IQRROC). Any data point with a rate of change exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very fast drops or increases in temperature. Secondly, in the resulting restricted raw data, the quartiles Q25 and Q75 and their interquartile distance (IQRLEVEL) were calculated. Any data point with a level exceeding 1 time the interquartile distance from Q25 or Q75 was removed. This step resulted in the rejection of very low temperatures. Thirdly, the resulting gaps in the single channels were interpolated linearly followed by an 11-point rectangular smoothing."</li>
<li>Prefer locations that are flat: "These locations were used because for long-term recordings the slightly larger area of the flat side gives a better fixation when taped onto the skin."</li>

<li>ME: wearable ECG sensor ranking: 12-leads ECG (a bit better, but lots of redundant info with 3-leads) &gt; 3-leads ECG with wet electrodes (sticky patches) &gt;&gt; 1-lead ECG with wet electrodes &gt; 1-lead ECG with chest strap &gt;&gt; 1-lead ECG on wrist &gt;&gt; Heart rate (no real-time QRS ECG) on wrist &gt; heart rate on finger (using oura ring or app). Chest strap is less good than wet or dry electrodes, but it's more reusable (so for long longitudinal study it's better).</li>
<li>My review: use new inexpensive smartwatches with continuous surface temperature measurements for COVID-19 such as Ticwris GTS: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/gj2plc/who_here_is_diagnosed_by_a_doctor_and_how_much/fqojeeq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/gj2plc/who_here_is_diagnosed_by_a_doctor_and_how_much/fqojeeq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/gj2plc/who_here_is_diagnosed_by_a_doctor_and_how_much/fqojeeq?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x</a> - bottom line: this is not accurate for absolute temperature measurements (so not for illnesses), but what matters for CRSWD is the variation throughout the day, so if the relative measures are coherent (ie, varying to reflect the core body temperature) then it's sufficient to determine Tmax and Tmin, and hence estimate the DLMO and optimal timing of intake of melatonin and light therapy and when to sleep/wake up. TODO: plot Tmin over several days/weeks to see if it correlates with wake up time or mid-sleep time point.

</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>plus also genetics study so can check all mutations of clock genes</li>
<li>this will be the longest longitudinal study on an individual with a circadian rhythm disorder. It will also be the most data rich, with 5 wearable devices, digital sleep log and genetics. I document my whole life. Similar self-study as the long MyConnectome dataset. <a href="http://myconnectome.org/wp/" title="http://myconnectome.org/wp/" class="http">http://myconnectome.org/wp/</a></li>
<li>BEST IDEA: to calibrate light sensor, use light therapy device at measured distance. Luminette &gt;= v2 is perfect because can do 500 lux and 1000 lux, perfect for AX3 and AX6 which are limited to 3-1000 lux. Should redo this as a calibration step once every month, to check for evolution (and degradation?) of the light sensor (assuming the Luminette light production is constant). Usually, calibration is only done on 1000 lux, but with both 500 and 1000 lux we can check the gradient is linear which is even better (2 points calibration). Could even do 3 points calibration with 1500 lux but AX3 is limited to 1000 lux max.

<li>"Without calibration the sensor can only be used qualitatively due to part variations; That is, comparison between devices is not possible. This is mainly because the sensor output is effected by the light attenuation of its particular enclosure, but also due to the variability of the sensor component. Some level of calibration is essential if the output is to be used quantitavely and to allow comparison between devices. The calibration must take into account the non-linear aspect of the logarithmic sensor and this should use the equation below which approximates the lux level at the sensor surface. A reasonable calibration can then be achieved by applying a coefficient to the approximated lux to take into account the linear attenuation of the enclosure."</li>

<li>if you want to find professional grade wearables, look up if they are configurable, in particular the sampling rate. This is often a difference between consumer grade product and professional grade, the latter are much more configurable and reliable, and this allows for a wider range of applications because decreasing the sampling rate allows for a longer battery and logging period.</li>

<h4>Clinical-grade continuous monitoring wearable devices list</h4>

<br>

<h5>Foreword (how to read this list)</h5>

<p>
This is a list of wearable devices with clinical-grade precision for continuous monitoring of vital parameters, the most important one for circadian rhythm disorders being temperature (which is also the least researched kind of sensor unfortunately, very difficult to non-invasively measure core body temperature).
</p>

<p>
The devices are NOT listed in any particular order. They are not all clinical-grade, but even if so, some are good consumer-grade devices (such as the Oura ring) that can still provide useful information for an affordable price.
</p>

<p>
The best devices in my opinion, that are both fit for clinical-grade uses and provide the most value for an affordable price, are tagged as "<b>BEST: name of device</b>". Indeed, devices such as <a href="https://www.escardio.org/Journals/E-Journal-of-Cardiology-Practice/Volume-10/Wearable-electronics-a-new-method-for-cardiac-rhythm-monitoring" title="continuous Holter ECG monitors used to cost $1000 in 2011" class="https">continuous Holter ECG monitors used to cost $1000 in 2011</a>, but technology progressed very fast and multi-leads devices are available for a much affordable price nowadays.
</p>

<p>
I have built this list along the way during my searches. Hence, it is not neatly ordered. I tried to separate the devices in broad categories, but the devices may not always fit, as they can have overlapping features (eg, a wrist wearable with both ECG and an accelerometer, which makes it fit for actigraphy if the sampling rate is high enough).
</p>

<p>
See the section above My Reviews for the devices I chose for my study.
</p>

<p>
This was written in the end of May 2020/beginning of June 2020, so I expect the devices list to change in the future, as the technology of wearables is evolving very fast, each year. But you can expect the big players such as AliveCor/Kardia to stay.
</p>

<h5>My criteria</h5>

What I need for my longitudinal study of CRSWD:<br>

<li>required: <b>temperature measurement</b>, ECG/PPG (heart measure), continuous monitoring 24h and more if possible, if possible real-time measurements (ie, not once per 10 minutes but each cardiac beat with the real shape), chest strap or at least biceps/arm band strap (and not finger nor wrist, because ambient events and temperature such as washing hands changes the temperature of hands-worn wearables), battery at least 2 days with a single charge but more (a week) is preferred, <b>raw data access</b> (very important for accurate post-processing on computer as they do for the UK BioBank for example), affordable for a non institutional buyer (&lt;500 euros for one device)</li>
<li>optional but very wished: bluetooth/wireless data communication, android app, data export, actigraph/accelerometer, <b>zero-heat-flux temperature for deep skin temperature closer to core body temperature (instead of infrared temperature sensor)</b></li>
<li>TO AVOID: any device where the raw data is not stored on-device and not accessible directly from the device connected to a computer (eg, if it requires a cloud website to download the data). An example is mybasis.com in 2013 which is now down and hence the data is not fetchable anymore even if you still own the device, and a modern example is Aidlab.</li>

<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
The accuracy of the sensors used in wrist-wearable devices is one of the main issues in the current commercial market. Many devices are considered to be good enough in different settings, excluding the clinical setting as the most delicate one. Studies are rarely executed on patients and especially on hospital inpatients. They largely focus on activity tracking such as in the study conducted by Case et al. [12] to evaluate the accuracy of step counts of commercially available devices. Their results indicate that measurements could be up to 20% lower compared to the observed step counts. On the contrary, Kroll et al. [6] conducted an observational study on patients in the intensive care unit to monitor the accuracy of the heart rate measurements of commercially available personal fitness trackers. Their results indicate that the heart rate measurements obtained by a personal fitness tracker were less accurate and consistent than the heart rate recorded by gold-standard measurements derived from electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Performance was even worse among patients who were not in sinus rhythm. These results suggest that wrist-wearable devices will require more clinical studies conducted in a real-world setting to test the accuracy of devices and detect which groups of people are suitable for monitoring physiological parameters with commercially available wrist-wearable devices."

<li>Explains fundamentals of body temperature + the major technologies behind most thermometers, with technical pros and cons and the equations.</li>
<li>"<b>Temperature, one of the oldest diagnostic parameters, is an important indicator of human health and disease</b>, both in everyday life and in the context of medical care. Measurement of body temperature is easy and accurate. The <b>mercury glass thermometer</b> is popular and shows <b>remarkable reliability</b>. However, safety of the mercury thermometer is inadequate, which has led to the development and popularity of electronic thermometers that use a thermistor."</li>
<li>"Clinically, <b>fever is a simple index of temperature change</b>. Although change in temperature represents fundamental information, continuous monitoring of body temperature and data processing are inconvenient. Most devices provide only intermittent temperature monitoring."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL:</b> "<b>Body temperature can be divided into core and skin surface temperature</b> (Fig. 1). <b>Mammals, including humans, are homoeothermic; i.e., they require an almost constant internal body temperature.</b> <b>Core temperature is defined as the temperature of the hypothalamus, which is the regulatory center of the body.</b>"</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image042.png"></li>
<li>"Researchers estimate core temperature by taking measurements in the auditory canal, esophagus, and stomach, but rectal temperature is a more accurate method of estimating hypothalamic temperature."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: link between core body temperature and circadian rhythm:</b> "<b>The core temperature is regulated by the thermoregulatory system with its center being the hypothalamus.</b> By means of <b>vasomotor, sweat and evaporation, this system is capable of maintaining the core temperature within a narrow range.</b> <b>Fluctuation of the core temperature obeys the circadian rhythm and shows the lowest value in the early morning and a peak in the afternoon or early evening with a difference about 1°C.</b>" → See also: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" class="https">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026</a></li>
<li>"The temperature of the <b>skin of the trunk usually varies between 33.5 and 36.9°C</b>. The temperature of the skin surface is lower over superficial veins than over superficial arteries. It is also lower over protruding and markedly curved parts such as the nose, ears, fingers and toes."</li>

<li>"Chez les mammifères, dont l'homme, <b>la glande pinéale a perdu cette fonction photoréceptrice</b> et <b>seules les cellules de la rétine contribuent à la perception de la luminosité ambiante</b>5. Cette information est traitée par le <b>noyau suprachiasmatique de l'hypothalamus qui orchestre la régulation circadienne</b>. Au sein de ce qu'on appelle le <b>système photoneuroendocrine</b>6, la glande pinéale ne joue donc qu'un rôle de transduction qui convertit le rythme imposé par le noyau suprachiasmatique en message hormonal endocrinien, via la sécrétion de l'hormone mélatonine5. La production de mélatonine est contrôlée par une voie rétino-hypothalamo (noyau suprachiasmatique)-médullaire (noyaux intermédio-latéraux)-pinéal via le ganglion cervical supérieur. La lumière inhibe la libération sanguine de la mélatonine. La mélatonine est libérée ainsi la nuit et concourt à adapter l'organisme au cycle nycthéméral (jour/nuit). La glande pinéale étant localisée en dehors de la barrière hémato-encéphalique7, la mélatonine va donc se distribuer dans l'ensemble du corps." → pineal gland is outside of hypothalamus and SCN is in hypothalamus, not pineal gland. But they work together, the pineal gland releases melatonin based on SCN outputs. Only the SCN is photoreceptive, the pineal gland only follows. <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glande_pin%C3%A9ale&oldid=171851054" title="https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glande_pin%C3%A9ale&amp;oldid=171851054" class="https">https://fr.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glande_pin%C3%A9ale&amp;oldid=171851054</a></li>
<li>"<b>The core temperature is regulated by the thermoregulatory system with its center being the hypothalamus. By means of vasomotor, sweat and evaporation, this system is capable of maintaining the core temperature within a narrow range. Fluctuation of the core temperature obeys the circadian rhythm and shows the lowest value in the early morning and a peak in the afternoon or early evening with a difference about 1°C.</b>"</li>
<li>"The temperature of the skin of the trunk usually varies between 33.5 and 36.9°C. <b>The temperature of the skin surface is lower over superficial veins than over superficial arteries. It is also lower over protruding and markedly curved parts such as the nose, ears, fingers and toes.</b>"</li>
<li>"The advantage of measuring skin temperature is the ease of access for the thermometer. However, the skin is located at the boundary of media with different temperatures. Moreover, fairly marked temperature gradients may develop, both in the tissue and in the environment, due to airflow, thermal radiation, sweating, skin blood flow and coverage by cloth. <b>Though the skin temperature is heterogeneous and vulnerable to ambient environment, it could still be a plausible index reflecting the change of core temperature according to the site of measurement and the level of activity [1].</b> <b>The skin temperature correlates to the core temperature by the thermoregulatory system as the main path to conduct heat exchange with the environment.</b> Hence, under <b>thermoneutral</b> situation, <b>the skin temperature on the sites, e.g. the upper thorax or the axilla, with relatively less influence by ambient environment, may be capable to reflect the change of core temperature [2].</b>"</li>
<li>"Basal body temperature (BBT) is defined as body temperature under basal conditions at rest; i.e., the lowest temperature of the body during a 24-h period. When metabolism is minimal, minimal heat is produced. Continuous monitoring of body temperature during sleep would allow determination of the true BBT, and female rhythm can be readily evaluated. Temperature shift is a good biological indicator that ovulation has taken place. The waking body temperature is low during menstruation and remains so until ovulation. After ovulation, the temperature increases by 0.8–1.0°C. An accurate digital thermometer is required to monitor BBT. Rhythmical studies generally involve intermittent use of a digital thermometer."</li>
<li>"Continuous measurement of skin temperature at the axilla is as good as episodic axillary temperature measurement [3]."</li>
<li>"Temperature detection can be classified into two types: contact and noncontact measurements. Contact thermometers such as thermistors, and integrated circuits (ICs) measure the average temperature between the sensor and the skin surface. In contrast, non-contact sensors such as thermopiles and pyrosensors measure the intensity of thermal radiation received from a known or calculated area on the surface."</li>
<li>"Most temperature monitoring is intermittent. In general monitoring applications such as checking for fever, intermittent temperature monitoring using contact and radiation thermometers is common. A probe in contact with the skin surface allows continuous temperature monitoring. Radiation thermometers facilitate non-contact measurement of skin temperature. The emissivity of the surface of the object should be considered to enhance measurement accuracy."</li>
<li>"Sites of temperature monitoring, whether continuous or intermittent, are dependent on the patient and their clinical condition. In surgical procedures, short and minimally invasive procedures may only require intermittent measurement, whereas a patient under general anesthesia requires continuous temperature monitoring."</li>
<li>"Sites of temperature monitoring include the skin axilla), esophagus, nasopharynx, tympanic membrane, blood, bladder/urine, and rectum. The skin is the most widely accepted site for temperature monitoring but provides unreliable measurements of the core body temperature. Tympanic probes measure brain temperature via the external carotid artery. However, the probe must be placed perfectly on the tympanic membrane. Nasopharyngeal probes that measure core temperature using respiratory gas can cause epistaxis. Rectal and bladder probes measure core body temperature with relatively easy access. However, the response is delayed if the core temperature changes rapidly. Pulmonary arterial catheters also measure the core temperature, but the technique is invasive. Esophageal probes are commonly used to measure core temperature under anesthesia. The probe, which is inserted via the mouth into the distal third of the esophagus, can also be used to monitor the heart beat and sound."</li>
<li>BEST method to calculate absolte temperature from NTC thermistor raw value: "A thermistor is a semiconductor-resistive temperature sensor made from sintered oxides of various metals. In the clinical context, negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors are commonly used as they exhibit a proportional decrease in resistance with an increase in temperature. Typically, the temperature coefficient of an NTC thermistor is approximately 0.04/K"</li>
<li>"Typically, thermistor temperature coefficients are non-linear over their operating range, which means that the coefficient itself varies somewhat with temperature. A coefficient is highest at the lowest temperature, and decreases as temperature increases. Thermistor measurement circuits must be linearized to cover large temperature ranges. [...] The best linearization is obtained by laying the inflation in the middle of the operation temperature target. The resistance of the paralleled resistor can then be calculated with minimum error."</li>
<li>"The best linearization is obtained by laying the inflation in the middle of the operation temperature target. The resistance of the paralleled resistor can then be calculated with minimum error."</li>
<li>BEST method equation to calculate absolute temperature from infrared thermometers: "The surface temperature of the object can be found from an empirical relation between V and Tobj or from a calibration table. This ambient temperature must be compensated using calibration data to obtain the correct object temperature."</li>
<li>"The radiation temperature sensors that are typically used in wearable thermometers are thermopiles or pyroelectric sensors."</li>
<li>"The main advantage of a thermopile is stability, as it has the same response to incoming radiant energy regardless of wavelength within the range 0.3–20 μm. The main disadvantage is that it has a comparatively slow speed of response, dependent upon the mass of the thermocouple elements and the rate at which heat is transferred from the hot to cold junctions."</li>
<li>"Wearable sensors have undergone substantial development over the past decade, mostly in the context of health-care applications via transduction of physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory rate, skin temperature and body motion [5–9]."</li>
<li>Mentions Tempdrop, iButtons, iFever, iSense, FeverFrida, STEMP (dead project, see the indiegogo page), TempTraq.</li>
<li>"Temperature monitoring is included because relatively easy constriction of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems works. Moreover, temperature sensors are relatively easy to fabricate."</li>
<li>"Wearable and attachable thermometers are popular for monitoring neonates and infants, and for measuring basal temperature. The purpose of such thermometers is monitoring of the skin surface temperature. Simple devices are attached to the head or axilla. In contrast, basal temperature monitoring devices allow continuous recording of temperature at night."</li>
<li>"Commercially available thermometers comprise a touchable temperature sensor (either a precision NTC thermistor or a semiconductor sensor), and a Bluetooth wireless transmitter. In most cases, data are collected by a smartphone or tablet. Graphical and tabular views of the data are presented by suitable applications. Temperature is automatically captured daily, and a chart is generated monthly. The client can access the raw data at any time to gain a better understanding of body temperature during periods of sleep. In some devices, data are transferred and securely stored in the cloud."</li>
<li>"Continuous monitoring of body temperature during the menstrual cycle is commonly performed in daily life. The BBT decreases at the end of the luteal phase."</li>
<li>"The BBT in-ear thermometer [15] comprises an earbud thermistor that collects temperature data in the ear canal. The soft silicone material enables the device to fit in the ear canal. Approximately 5 min is required for the sensor to reach equilibrium at room temperature, while approximately 20 min is required at lower temperatures."</li>
<li>"Simply touching a 1-Wire® probe to the DS1921H reveals the surrounding temperature in the range of 15–46°C, with an accuracy of ±1°C and resolution of 0.125°C." Current Developments in Wearable Thermometers, 2018 <a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" title="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf" class="https">https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/abe/7/0/7_7_88/_pdf</a></li>
<li>"Therefore, use of the wireless iButtons® device is a valid means of measuring human skin temperature during laboratory and field investigations, particularly when skin temperature measurement using other currently available methods may prove problematic. As mentioned above, the skin temperature fluctuates according to the influences of external and endogenous thermoregulatory systems. However, on the basis of published studies and data using wearable thermometers [18,19], with appropriate installation, the skin temperature reflects the change in core temperature."</li>
<li>"Three types of adhesive thermometer are available: a small wearable device with an adhesive plaster that is reusable several times, tattoo temperature sensors and disposable sensors. The advantage of an adhesive thermometer lies in its ease of handling and the fact that it can be peeled off easily; its disadvantage is that repeated application and removal of the adhesive material may irritate the skin of neonates."</li>
<li>"Wearable electrical patches were first developed using plastic materials, and consisted of analog front-end electronics and a low-power microprocessor with a built-in radio. The current through the microprocessor varies from a few microamperes with the radio switched off to a few milliamperes with the radio switched on [8, 20, 21]."</li>
<li>"Other wirelessly powered patch devices have been developed using thick films [21]. Thick-film electrodes are screen-printed on fabric using planar-fashionable circuit board (P-PCB) technology, in which stainless steel powder is added to reduce both contact impedance and motion artifacts. A programmable gain and bandwidth amplifier is implemented to accommodate various dynamic ranges of vital signals. The sensor must be flexible enough to contact the skin. The flexible printed circuit board can easily monitor vital signs but is too stiff to attach directly to the skin. Thus, a soft adhesive patch is applied between the circuit board and the skin. This type of structure is used in commercially available electrical patches."</li>
<li>"The medical-grade adhesive similar to that found in high-quality bandages is safe for children and sensitive skin, even when worn for hours or days (5–7 days is recommended)."</li>
<li>"Temporary transfer tattoo temperature monitor. The novel hybrid fabrication techniques and electronic materials pioneered by Rogers et al. [25–27] have enabled development of advanced electronic devices that can contact the epidermis for measurement of physiological parameters including skin temperature. The sensor circuit is mounted on a biocompatible material, such as artificial skin."</li>
<li>Future thermometers: "Register-based temperature sensors such as platinum resistors are used [25]. These sensors are 50 µm wide, or about half the width of the average human hair, and are made of either thin wavy gold wires or silicon membranes mounted on an ultra-thin rubbery sheet that is perforated to help the skin breathe and behave naturally. The sensors adhere to human skin and measure temperatures with millikelvin precision. The prototypes of these devices showed the capability of gathering clinically useful data such as blood flow and skin hydration level with extremely high sensitivity."</li>
<li>Standards: "The temperature accuracy of ±0.1°C meets the ASTM E1112 performance standard."</li>
<li>ZHF (zero-heat-flux): "Wearable deep body thermometers. Deep body thermometers (DBTs) have been developed to monitor core temperature non-invasively, and were originally proposed in the 1970s by Fox and Solman [36] based on the zero-heat-flow principle. A cutaneous probe is heated to an extent that no temperature gradient exists inside the probe, so that no heat will flow into the probe from the skin and thus no heat will flow from inside the body to the skin. The deep body temperature will then be equal to the value measured by the probe. This method was subsequently improved by Nemoto and Togawa, and Terumo Co. (Tokyo, Japan) [37]. The thermometer fabricated by Terumo has been approved for use as a medical device by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) of Japan and has been shown to correlate well with blood temperature during cardiopulmonary surgery [38]. This thermometer uses a heater to compensate for heat flow, and its use as a wearable device is problematic due to insufficient power for longterm use."</li>
<li><b>BEST METHODS: DHFM (dual-heat-flux) equations to calculate temperature from 4 sensors, very simple!</b> "<b>To develop a wearable DBT, the dual heat-flux method (DHFM) has been used.</b> DHFM, which is a relatively new method that calculates the DBT based on the heat flux inside a probe, was originally proposed by Kitamura et al. [39]. The double heat path inside the probe enables calculation of the DBT by the temperature sensors. A substrate material with four embedded temperature sensors comprises the core of the probe. The substrate material has physical properties similar to those of skin and, when attached to the skin, most of the heat flow from the core body due to the difference between the DBT and the skin temperature will flow into the substrate material. Additionally, under a heat isolation peripheral boundary condition, heat will flow longitudinally. Since the two heat paths (T1–T3, T2–T4) are located transversely close to each other, the thermal resistors in the skin layer of the two heat paths are the same, and thus the DBT can be calculated from the measurements of the four sensors (T1–T4) using the equation below, where k (= R1/R2) is the ratio of heat resistors inside the probes within the two heat paths."</li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image041.png"></li>
<li>"A comparative study was performed with reference to a deep body thermometer (CoreTemp, CM-210, Terumo, Tokyo Japan). CoreTemp <b>measures tissue temperature below 10 mm of skin surface</b> and is used as a standard thermometer for monitoring deep body temperature. The prototype of DHFM device provided measurements with a difference of less than 0.1°C compared to the reference thermometer. However, a urethane sponge cover must be used. Huang et al. improved this method by means of theoretical simulation and experimental validation [40–42]. Removal of the external heater markedly reduces the power consumption of the device and thus facilitates its use as a wearable sensor. We have tested the basic performance of this device in practical terms [43] [Fig. 12 (b)]."</li>
<li><b>BEST standards for temperature monitoring:</b> "Most devices meet clinical accuracy standards, such as <b>ISO 80601-2-56 and ASTM E1112</b>. Devices are considered to be in agreement if they meet the clinically meaningful recommendations of <b>mean differences of ±0.5°C and limits of agreement of ±1.0°C</b> [44]. We note that <b>ISO standard and ASTM assume that the clinical accuracy of clinical thermometer can be sufficiently determined under laboratory condition, and tests do not include the characteristics of the patient and the environment. Thus, we evaluate the clinical accuracy in clinical practice.</b>"</li>
<li>"Although paste-on sensors are inexpensive and allow physicians to monitor patients as they move freely, these devices cannot monitor changes across the skin. Moreover, they irritate the skin, which affects its natural responses. While infrared cameras permit high-precision temperature measurements across the skin, they require patients to maintain a stable posture. Next-generation temporary tattoo thermometers are promising. In the future, thermometers that can wirelessly broadcast their measurements will likely be developed. Furthermore, <b>wearable deep body thermometer is promising technology to monitor circadian rhythms</b> and mental stress in daily life. The development of a device with <b>clinically acceptable accuracy</b> will become <b>an issue in the future</b>."</li>

<h5>Actigraphy and light sensor devices</h5>

<p>
For sleep studies, actigraphy should be combined with a light sensor to measure the ambient light the user is exposed to, this can provide critical information. Two ways of having light sensors: on the wrist with the accelerometer (actigraphy) component, which is more affordable but much less precise, or close to the head (pendant or pin or best being close to the eyes) for best results. There are also two kinds of light sensors: photopic/lux (to measure light intensity) which is the most common and affordable, and RGB/spectrometer which measures colors spectrum but is much more expensive and less common in wearables.

<li>"The GENEActiv output had a strong linear relationship with photopic illuminance. However, the devices consistently under-reported photopic illuminance, especially below 100 lux. Accuracy below 100 lux depended on the light source, with lower accuracy and higher variability under fluorescent lighting. The device’s accuracy was also tested using light sources of varying spectral composition, which indicated that the device tends to under-report photopic illuminance for green light sources and over-report for red light sources. Furthermore, measures of photopic illuminance <b>were impacted by infrared light exposure</b>." → this is because the spectral range is too big (400-1100nm), Axivity AX3/6 should not have this issue since it's calibrated under a shorter range similar to human eyes (450-650nm)</li>

<ul>
<li>"The <b>Daysimeters had better photometric performance than the Actiwatch Spectrum</b>. To assess differences associated with measuring light and activity levels at different locations on the body, older adults wore four Daysimeters and an Actiwatch Spectrum for five consecutive days. <b>Wearing the Daysimeter or Actiwatch Spectrum on the wrist compromises accurate light measurements relative to locating a calibrated photosensor at the plane of the cornea</b>."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL:</b> "The characteristics of retinal light exposures affecting the various channels of the human visual system are quite different than those affecting the circadian system due to different neural processing for these two systems.1 The visual system exhibits a large dynamic response range, from faint starlight to full sun, over some 9 or 10 orders of magnitude. As shown by <b>acute melatonin suppression</b>, <b>the circadian system exhibits a high threshold and rapid saturation response characteristic to optical radiation incident on the retina, with dynamic range of no more than 2 orders of magnitude</b>.2 Even though some of the same photoreceptors participate in both the visual and circadian systems, the two systems have very different spectral sensitivities to light. The circadian system is maximally sensitive to short wavelengths (λmax ≈ 460 nm), whereas the fovea, used for high spatial resolution, has peak sensitivity at longer wavelengths (λmax = 555 nm).3"</li>
<li>Daysimeter-S is the most precise (at eye levels) whereas Daysimeter-D (dime) is similar to an actigraphy watch, can be placed elsewhere, with less accurate results:
<ul>
<li>Figure 6: <img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image018.png" width="450"> - wearing light sensor on the wrist is the worst in terms of light intensity (lux), maybe because of cloths? Not even because of cloths! Just location!</li>
<li>"Comparisons of CS values measured near the eye with the Daysimeter to those measured at other locations primarily reflect the effects of different measurement locations (Figure 6) because both devices have been calibrated the same way. The differences in CS measured at the eye and measured at the three other locations were surprisingly small, typically less than 10% over the range of hourly average CS values, suggesting that measuring light at locations other than near the eye introduces minimal errors in assessing circadian-effective light exposure. However, when device locations are compared in terms of photopic illuminance levels, the magnitudes of the differences can be quite large. Indeed, placing the Daysimeter on the wrist, rather than close to the cornea, yielded large differences in the absolute levels of photopic illuminance (in lux), especially at high levels when the CS values would already be near saturation. The photopic illuminance measurements taken by the Daysimeter near the eye and those taken by the Daysimeter used as a pin or a pendant were similar (Figure 6). Thus, these data underscore the potential problems in measuring light exposures at the wrist for use as surrogates for corneal light exposures. In winter months when long-sleeved clothing is worn, light measurements on the wrist will undoubtedly be lower than in the summer, when people wear short sleeves, daylengths are longer, and the sun is higher in the sky. The field data reported here were collected between August and January, with the majority of the data collected during warmer temperatures. <b>Even larger differences between photopic illuminance measurements from the Daysimeter at the eye and at the wrist would be expected if they were only obtained during the winter months</b>."</li>
<li>"It should also be noted that the spatial response of the human eye is much like a three-dimensional cosine sensitivity, notwithstanding occlusion by the nose and brow.15"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>BEST: explanation why DSPD and non24 gets worse in the summer, not only because of DST time change but also because more blue light in the evening during summer than winter?</b> "Based on the “blue” sensor data from the Actiwatch Spectrum, the authors concluded that <b>summer evenings had significantly more short-wavelength content than winter evenings</b>. Although this may be true,21 seasonal differences actually measured may reflect artifacts of the inherent absolute, spectral, and spatial characteristics of the Actiwatch Spectrum and how it was worn on the wrist during the winter (with long-sleeved clothing) and during the summer (without long-sleeved clothing). It would be interesting to <b>repeat the study with the Daysimeter to verify</b> if indeed winter evenings are less rich in short-wavelength corneal irradiance than summer evenings."</li>

<li>Pros: Photopic (light intensity) and spectral (RGB color) light sensor, 2 Hz sampling rate to 1 sample per 30 seconds, 3-axis actigraphy/accelerometer included (32 Hz), several anatomical mounts like the Daysimeter (Eyeglasses, Headset, Badge, Necklace), battery of several days (3 months in standby, but how much in use?

<h5>Temperature (skin or core body) devices</h5>

<p>
All devices measuring skin temperature from the limbs (fingers, wrist) are de facto rejected because too sensitive to ambient noise.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><b>BEST: Thermocron iButton (from Maxim Integrated or Dallas):</b>
<ul>
<li>Pros: very inexpensive ($40 one iButton, ~$120 for the starter kit with the necessary tool to connect to a computer with USB to transfer data), sampling rate 1 Hz (1 sample every seconds) or 1 sample every 5 minutes or 1 sample every 273h and is fully configurable, temperature resolution option: low 0.5°C or high 0.0625°C, small and can be placed anywhere on the body, long battery and internal memory, easy access to raw data (simple CSV export with timestamp), open source softwares and API and firmware!</li>
<li>Cons: no bluetooth so need to put the iButton in the bluedot receiver and connect to computer using USB, with DS1922L we get the highest sampling rate up to 1 Hz but memory becomes full very fast and battery is drained very fast, whereas DS1925L has a much bigger battery (212 days of recording at 1 sample every 5 minutes) but the highest sampling rate is 1 sample per 5 minutes. Ideally, we would want 1 sample every 1 or 2 minutes. Once the battery is drained, it's not rechargeable, so either you manually replace it with a brand new one, or throw the iButton and buy a new one. On the DS1925L, the battery should last 4 years with one sample every 5 minutes, whereas the DS1922L lasts half a year with 1 sample every 1 or 2 minutes. Only measures skin temperature obviously, not core body temperature, BUT it was shown to be <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40033570_The_validity_of_wireless_iButtonsR_and_thermistors_for_human_skin_temperature_measurement" title="more reliable at reflecting skin temperature than ambient temperature compared to thermistors" class="https">more reliable at reflecting skin temperature than ambient temperature compared to thermistors</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.11.003" title="thermistors placed in the axillary (under the armpit) reflects relative changes in core body temperature" class="https">thermistors placed in the axillary (under the armpit) reflects relative changes in core body temperature</a>, hence an iButton in the axillary should reflect accurately reflect changes in the core body temperature (but not the actual absolute value). Another possibility is to use 2 iButtons, one on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.04.026" title="a proximal site and one on a distal site, the difference showing changes in the circadian rhythm" class="https">a proximal site and one on a distal site, the difference showing changes in the circadian rhythm</a>.</li>
<li>Specific iButton used here, already pre-calibrated: <a href="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1922L.html" title="https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1922L.html" class="https">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/ibutton-one-wire/data-loggers/DS1922L.html</a></li>
<li>Don't forget to buy an already calibrated version against NIST! Such as from Maxim Integrated:
<ul>
<li>"While all iButton data loggers are calibrated/validated against NIST traceable reference devices, Maxim offers a web application to generate validation certificates for the DS1922L/T data loggers. Input is an iButton registration number (or list of numbers) and the output is a validation certificate in PDF format."</li>
<li>iButtonLink/Thermocron does NOT include NIST calibration</li>
<li>How is certification done: <a href="https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN4629.pdf" title="https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN4629.pdf" class="https">https://pdfserv.maximintegrated.com/en/an/AN4629.pdf</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VALIDATION: lots of studies have used the iButton DS1922L and validated it. But the DS1925L not as much, since it came out in 2016, but we can expect similar performances (albeit a smaller sampling rate).
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Main differences: DS1925 can retrieve data even if battery dead, DS1922 has better sampling resolution (up to 1Hz, whereas DS1925 is one sample every 5 min), and no NIST calibration for DS1925? And evaluation kit is &lt; 100€ for DS1925, with everything necessary to connect and use, and above all: 122KB memory (125440 samples) with DS1925 versus 8KB memory with DS1922. Both are IP56 (water resistant - but not waterproof! so don't use under shower!). DS1925 went out in 2016, DS1922 is here since at least 2010 but likely before.</li>
<li>Log duration:
<ul>
<li>One sample every 5 min as done <a href="https://eudl.eu/pdf/10.4108/eai.20-5-2019.2282879" title="here" class="https">here</a>: 28 days with DS1922 or 435 days with DS1925 (212 days with high temperature resolution of 0.0625°C).</li>
<li>One sample every 1 min at high temperature resolution (at 0.0625°C) as advised <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40033570_The_validity_of_wireless_iButtonsR_and_thermistors_for_human_skin_temperature_measurement" title="here" class="https">here</a>: 5.6 days with DS1922, impossible with DS1925.</li>

<li>Cons: infrared temperature (less reliable than contact thermistor in axillary or zero-heat-flux), actigraphy data not stored and cannot be fetched (only realtime access available currently), no raw temperature data access, hidden paywall (premium plan to get necessary features such as access to minutes resolution of the data and 100h of raw data storage, else it's only 10h with the free plan, not sufficient to download the raw data), internal storage max 64MB = 6h of recording, then needs to be paired to transfer data, data can only be accessed and downloaded through the website/cloud hence if it goes down we lose all access to logged data (as it happened with the now defunct mybasis.com). The 24/7 continuous monitoring of vital signs is untrue since it is impossible with the current device.</li>

<li>Against Suunto MoveSense and Polar: "Don't get a sports watch with HR functionality (e.g. Suunto or Polar). As much as the basic signal might (occasionally and under the right circumstances) be accurate enough, they RR intervals and not a raw ECG. This is a disadvantage which affects your ability to determine the accuracy of the data. These days, due to advances in sensor and microprocessor tech, integrated circuits etc. these watches are no longer a 'cheap' solution.

<li>"What are the normal temperature ranges?"
<ul>
<li>"It is essential to know that different thermometer methods give different body temperature readings. Generally, a rectal reading is around 0.5 °C higher than an oral reading. And an armpit or forehead scanner is 0.5 °C lower than an oral meeting. Some thermometers take these differences into account and show a temperature with an offset, and some don´t. Therefore it is always important to read the user guide. <b>Our value is the actual (rectal) core temperature.</b> A normal body temperature is between 97°F (36.1°C) to 99°F (37.2°C)."</li>

<li>Ticwris GTS smartwatch
<ul>
<li>Pros: cheap price ($30), heart rate/PPG (no ECG), <b>temperature sensor (contact, not infrared)</b>, accelerometer/actigraphy, continuous monitoring over several days, long battery, heart rate accuracy seems ok</li>
<li>Cons: <b>temperature resolution is very low (1°C step)</b>, buggy app (randomly stops acquiring temperature), sampling rate is 1 every 10 minutes (0.001 Hz, although this is artificial because the measurements are faster than that, but the app doesn't allow a faster monitoring), closed source algorithms, no access to raw data, very itchy strap that can produce allergies after 24h, accelerometer very bad (can't detect sleep if sleeping outside of the night, hence not appropriate for DSPD or non-24) → disadvised, clearly not medical-grade and reliability of measurements is very questionable</li>
<li>My tips: ticwris gts records temperature continously and unattended only when the app LinkTo Sports is launched and bluetooth is enabled, because the watch doesn't store the temperature measurements (contrary to the heart rate which is stored in the watch and uploaded whenever the app is launched). Hence, the app needs to be launched (disable Android's battery optimization to prevent the app from being closed, or "lock" the app to avoid that) and keep it in focus (even if screen is off) and with the "body temperature" records page opened whenever possible (it's not necessary to have the app on focus all the time for the data to be uploaded, but it ensures Android won't close it particularly if the screen is off). Else, if the app does not stay on the "body temperature" records page, the app may be put into hibernation by Android and hence no data will be loggued.  Also, temperature needs to be &gt; 35° (body temperature approximately calculated by the app's algorithm, not the surface temperature from the sensors), else the temperature is not recorded in the app. The surface temperature seems to range from 31° to 36°. Tip: wear the watch the highest possible on your arm, you will get more stable temperature measurements. Note finally there is no way to export the data currently.</li>
<li>Advanced tips: Ticwris gts measures temperature and heartbeat every 10 minutes automatically. Heartbeat can be measured continuously on the watch if left on the heart rate screen, great for real-time heart rate monitoring. Temperature can be made much more reliable by attaching close to the armpit, towards the interior, by extending the strap using a long cerflex. No smartwatch is made to be worn more than 24h, and this one is no exception, so that an allergic reaction may occur after (very itchy and skin suffers from a weird reaction). If that's the case, plan ahead and clean up the smartwatch and its strap once a day and switch to the other arm.</li>

<li>Oura ring (but since it's on the fingers, only biological night time measurements when sleeping and hence not using nor washing the hands are reliable as they say themselves): <a href="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025587493-How-Does-Oura-Measure-Body-Temperature" title="https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025587493-How-Does-Oura-Measure-Body-Temperature" class="https">https://support.ouraring.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025587493-How-Does-Oura-Measure-Body-Temperature</a>- and <a href="https://ouraring.com/circadian-rhythms-bedtime" title="https://ouraring.com/circadian-rhythms-bedtime" class="https">https://ouraring.com/circadian-rhythms-bedtime</a> - price: 314€ <a href="https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver" title="https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver" class="https">https://ouraring.com/product/heritage-silver</a>
<ul>
<li>Pros: temperature (<a href="https://ouraring.com/ring-technology" title="Negative temperature coefficient" class="https">Negative temperature coefficient</a> (NTC) sensor for body temperature), heart rate via PPG (no ecg), 3-axis actigraphy, <a href="https://ouraring.com/tags-covid19-flu-cold" title="tags (but not custom)" class="https">tags (but not custom)</a></li>
<li>Cons: on the fingers, so less precise for temperature (can be modified by simply washing hands...), <b>temperature only meant to be acquired at night because during the day too many confounds (washing hands, ambient temperature, etc), </b>not clinical-grade</li>
<li>For an all-in-one portable consumer-grade device but close to clinical-grade, it's probably the best.</li>

<li>"We investigated the cardio-autonomic and psychological effects of <b>colored light cycling with the wavelength of ultradian rhythms</b>. In two consecutive experiments, an explorative, longitudinal test followed by a randomized crossover design, 20 healthy subjects each were exposed to oscillating red, green and blue light."</li>
<li>"Vigilance showed improvement over the two weeks (p ≤ .001) in the longitudinal study. External color light cycling at the wavelength of blood pressure oscillations appears to amplify the endogenous autonomic oscillations. This leads to an optimization of cardio-autonomic control; an effect that was reflected shortly after the onset of the light exposure sessions by the increase of heart rate variability. From the results, we conclude that it takes repeated light exposure session to foster the positive effects on the psychological aspects, as we observed an increase of subjectively perceived mood only in the longitudinal study, not for the crossover design study. The results of our study imply some possible health effects of a color light exposure that is adjusted to 10 s and 1 min oscillations of humans' ultradian rhythms."</li>
<li>Definition of ultradian: "In chronobiology, an ultradian rhythm is a recurrent period or cycle repeated throughout a 24-hour day.

<li>Technical doc: "More recently, technological advancements have allowed users to generate rhythm strips from their smartphones or smartwatches. This system uses an external case (that acts as electrodes when touched by the right or left hand of the user) and a downloadable application on a smartphone, which together form an “event monitor.” The cardiac electrical signal is converted to an ultrasound FM sound signal, and the application in the smartphone then demodulates the signal to a digital EKG tracing. The EKG is generated in real time, and can be stored and instantaneously transmitted by the phone to a secure server for further analysis.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
The first product of its kind is the KardiaMobile case or card (AliveCor), which consists of two metal electrodes on the back of a case that clips on or attaches to a smartphone. Following its FDA 510(k) approval in 2012, the device became available for prescription in 2013, and received over-the-counter approval in 2014 as a single-channel ECG recorder.6 The technology has demonstrated a sensitivity of 94-100% and a specificity of 91-95% for detecting atrial fibrillation, and has proven to be a simple and cost-effective method of screening for this arrhythmia.7,8 The utility of this device system has been studied in varied clinical settings.9,10" <a href="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" title="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" class="https">https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review</a>
</div>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>"However, this device system has its own limitations like AliveCor. Tracings tend to have more baseline artifacts than standard 12-lead EKGs, making accurate recording and documentation of ventricular rhythms such as monomorphic VT or polymorphic VT very difficult at times.12 Another limitation of such device systems is that the patient must be able to activate the smartphone for an event to be recorded. Therefore, its utility in patients with very transient symptoms is questionable. Implantable loop recorders or event monitors remain the gold standard in such cases."</li>

<li>FDA-approved since january 2013: <a href="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" title="https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review" class="https">https://www.eplabdigest.com/articles/Current-Advances-Wearable-Health-Technology-Review</a>
<ul>
<li>"However, this device system has its own limitations like AliveCor. Tracings tend to have more baseline artifacts than standard 12-lead EKGs, making accurate recording and documentation of ventricular rhythms such as monomorphic VT or polymorphic VT very difficult at times.12 Another limitation of such device systems is that the patient must be able to activate the smartphone for an event to be recorded. Therefore, its utility in patients with very transient symptoms is questionable. Implantable loop recorders or event monitors remain the gold standard in such cases."</li>

Sensitivity of the dermal thermometers for detecting core temperatures ≥38.0 °C was low, ranging from 0.33 to 0.6, but improved to 0.60 to 0.80 after adjusting temperatures by the methods' average deviation from rectal temperature. The results from the dermal thermometers tested here showed an insufficient correlation to core temperature to be used for core temperature monitoring in clinical research and practice. Unfortunately, other options for non-invasive temperature measurements are few. The two thermometers with the least unsatisfactory performance profile in our evaluations were the Feversmart and iThermonitor systems."</li>

The user puts his right index or second finger on the sensor, and the signal recorded is then processed through an app with built-in algorithms for AF detection. McManus et al demonstrated excellent specificity (0.975), sensitivity (0.962), and accuracy (0.968) using an iPhone 4S camera and algorithm.14 Chan et al also compared the Cardiio Rhythm smartphone PPG application with the AliveCor automated algorithm, and found a sensitivity of 92.9% for PPG technology (higher than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm) as well as a specificity of 97.7% for PPG technology (comparable with AliveCor). However, the positive predictive value of PPG technology was lower (53.1% vs 76.9%) than the AliveCor automated algorithm.15 The PPG technology also has its own limitations; for example, it cannot differentiate between frequent atrial premature beats or atrial arrhythmias, which may lead to false diagnoses of atrial fibrillation.</li>

One study of 61 DSPD patients, with average sleep onset at about 3:00 am and average waking time of about 11:30 am, was followed with questionnaires to the subjects after a year. Good effect was seen during the six-week treatment with a large daily dose of melatonin. Follow-up showed that over 90% had relapsed to pre-treatment sleeping patterns within the year, 29% reporting that the relapse occurred within one week.

<li>“In our study, we have found that these two devices have comparable effects on sleepiness and sustained attention.Nevertheless, the two devices emit light at different wavelength spectrums and intensity, which can have different physiological consequences. While the conventional LT box used in this study (EnergyLight®) emits a polychromatic white light at 10,000 Lux, the LT glasses used in this study (Luminette®) emits a blue-enriched polychromatic white light, which may exert stronger effects on physiology and behavior. Indeed, the non-image forming effects of light are primarily mediated by melanopsin-based phototransduction with a peak sensitivity of melanopsin located within the blue spectrum. The similarity of the results between LT glasses and box suggests however that <b>polychromatic white light without blue enrichment is sufficient to produce beneficial effects</b>, as previously observed in studies examining melatonin suppression by light. Sasseville et al. also recently demonstrated that LT at the middle of the night (3 am) during 30 minutes at 500 μW/cm² could be as effective with or without the contribution of short-wavelength on subjective alertness and energy, thus suggesting that direct non-image forming effects of light are also mediated by rods and cones. Our results are consistent with those of Sasseville et al., as we didn’t show differences in our study between white polychromatic LT (Philips) and blue-enriched LT (Lucimed): thus, bright light therapy produces its effect non solely via melanopsin pathways. However, two hours after LT, vigilance improvement induced by LT glasses was higher than that produced by LT boxes, <b>suggesting a more prolonged effect of LT glasses which might result from greater blue light enrichment</b>. Future studies with different monochromatic lights will help us to disentangle the different pathways of the non-image forming effects of light.”</li>

<li>"increases in S cone activation lead to a dilation of the pupil [80, 100], which is also controlled by the ipRGCs"</li>
<li>"It has long been thought that cones and rods mediate what is typically considered “vision” (seeing colour, motion, spatial detail), and that melanopsin mediates the “other”, non-visual effects of light, i.e. melatonin suppression, circadian phase shifting, and alertness. However, at second sight, this dichotomy breaks down. There is now converging evidence that melanopsin signals reach the primary visual cortex (V1) [82], where they may contribute to and modulate our visual perception [20, 25, 109]."</li>
<li>"It is important to keep in mind that the retinal photoreceptors experience an altered version of the light relative to the cornea, the front surface of the eye. This is because the eye itself contains filters. In the centre of the retina, this includes the macular pigment, which is present in the fovea but drops off in the peripheral retina. More importantly for ipRGCs, the crystalline lens and ocular media filter out short-wavelength light. <b>This natural “blue-blocking” filter increases density with increasing age</b>, with less and less short-wavelength light reaching the retina."</li>
<li><b>BEST: light both suppress melatonin and shift the circadian rhythm using 2 separate mechanisms! Goes along the way of functional decoupling:</b> "Two effects of light have been interrogated extensively in human circadian and sleep research: (1) the acute suppression of melatonin in response to light exposure and (2) the ability of light exposure to shift circadian phase. <b>However, these two effects are not arising from a unitary pathway resulting in a direct relationship between melatonin suppression and phase shifts. There is now accruing evidence that they may be indeed separable</b> [63]. As a consequence, one should not be used as a proxy for the other [106]."

<li>Why so few studies on circadian rhythm? "Studying light-induced phase shifting responses of the circadian clock in humans is expensive, time consuming and difficult. It takes days or weeks to examine the light-induced circadian phase shifting response of a single participant." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a></li>

</li>
<li>"The system mediating melatonin suppression has a spectral sensitivity that is broadly consistent with the spectral sensitivity of melanopsin [17, 60, 88]. Similarly, the spectral sensitivity of circadian phase shifting shows its maximal effect near the peak spectral sensitivity of melanopsin [101]."</li>
<li><b>pulsed light + multiple light sessions</b>: "The human circadian system integrates across multiple light exposures as short as five minutes [48], even intermittent bright light exposure can shift the circadian phase [43, 66]. It has been shown that under certain circumstances, a train of very brief flashes light flashes on the millisecond scale can cause circadian phase shifts which are larger than those caused by continuous light [59, 108]."
<ul>
<li>+ this study that shows that pulsed light can produce more phase shift with less melatonin suppression: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/</a></li>
<li>pulsed intermittent light efficiency is at least known since 2004! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146</a>
<ul>
<li>"As such, other non-image forming photoreceptive behaviours have been used as proxies for light-induced circadian phase shifting responses. These include light-induced melatonin suppression, which is much faster and less expensive to study. Implicit in these studies is that by examining the impact of light on this proxy behaviour, we can induce the manner by which the circadian clock would respond to the same light stimulus. These proxy responses are, as is circadian phase shifting, mediated by the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT), formed by axons arising from the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) (Hattar et al. 2002). So, the inductive reasoning goes that understanding one output of the RHT (melatonin suppression) will inform us about the output of interest (phase shifting). It must be noted, however, that there is no direct evidence that light-induced melatonin suppression is mediated by the circadian clock (suprachiasmatic nucleus, SCN). As the SCN is necessary for the production of melatonin, it has thus far been impossible to test whether the SCN is also necessary for the light-induced suppression of melatonin. Indeed, the RHT innervates many loci in the hypothalamus, including the paraventricular nucleus, which is part of the pathway leading from the SCN to the pineal, indicating that there is at least anatomical evidence that the physiological pathways leading to different aspects of non-image forming photoreception may be separable. Furthermore, the RHT does not arise from a uniform set of ipRGCs. Studies in mice have identified <b>at least six different subtypes of ipRGC</b> (Sexton et al. 2012)."</li>
<li>"To address this question, in an article in this issue of The Journal of Physiology, Rahman and colleagues studied 59 participants who were exposed to a variety of light stimuli ranging from continuous dim or bright light to pulses of bright light with interspersed darkness (Rahman et al. 2018). They report that, under these conditions, there is no significant correlation between light-induced melatonin suppression and light-induced phase shifting of the circadian clock. In some individuals exposed to long duration (6.5 h) light, robust phase shifts were accompanied by negligible suppression of melatonin (Fig. 2 in Rahman et al.). In some individuals exposed to an hour or less of light, robust suppression of melatonin was accompanied by negligible phase shifts (Fig. 2 in Rahman et al.). The data presented indicate that light induction of melatonin suppression and light induction of circadian phase shifts are separable phenomena. Previous studies using different light stimuli, including red light (Zeitzer et al. 1997) and millisecond flashes of light (Zeitzer et al. 2011), had previously reported on the poor correlation between light-induced melatonin suppression and light-induced changes in circadian phase. In these studies, the authors observed an absence of or an inconsistent melatonin suppression in response to light that induced shifts of circadian phase. In all of these studies, it appears that physiologically significant phase shifts can be induced by specific light stimuli in the absence of an accompanying robust decline in melatonin. Thus, while the overall sensitivity to light-induced melatonin suppression and light-induced circadian phase shifting is similar, these two non-image forming functions of light are not necessarily mediated by the same neural pathways and are not necessarily proxies for one another."</li>

<li>Again similar results, with melatonin suppression under a similar timeframe (under 20 min) for both intermittent light therapy and continuous + light therapy increases cortisol levels acutely (but may be due to stress - <b>starting with the eyes  closed may fix the issue? The acute increase in cortisol levels may be the reason why some people get headaches?</b>): <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/</a>

<li>+ "Moreover, short duration stimuli are more effective than long duration stimuli, on a per minute basis (e.g., <b>each minute in a single 12 min stimulus resets the pacemaker 8 times more than per minute of a 4 h stimulus</b>5). Recently, <b>millisecond flashes delivered over one hour has also been shown to induce significant phase shifts</b>68,69."</li>
<li>"Our work shows that the suppressive effects of light exposure on melatonin occur rapidly whereas recovery is a relatively slower process. There are robust and complex changes in cortisol, suggesting an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and modulation of the feedback mechanism in this pathway."</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Both melatonin suppression and circadian phase shifts are modulated by the “<b>photic history</b>”, i.e. the amount of light seen during the day [27, 44, 77]. The long-term adaptive influences of the “spectral diet” in the real world remain an important area of investigation [93]."
<ul>
<li>SUMMARY: dark therapy is important because by dimming light (and avoiding the blue colored lights), then the effect of melatonin suppression at wake up is bigger!

<li>"Specifically, the activity of the circadian pacemaker is aligned to counteract the increasing sleep pressure resulting from sustained wakefulness during daytime. Likewise, the nocturnal increase in circadian sleep tendency counteracts the decrease in sleep propensity resulting from accumulated sleep thereby supporting a consolidated phase of nocturnal sleep."</li>
<li>"Here, shorter daylight exposure and longer nights are associated with a longer biological night as indexed by the duration of melatonin secretion, and thus longer sleep duration [85, 94, 95], which may also reflect a seasonality effect [104]."</li>
<li>"Beyond this, sleep quality is also related to light exposure during the day. Several studies report that daytime exposure to white light enriched in short-wavelength content was associated with <b>increased evening fatigue [91], and sleep quality [16, 39, 91], decreased sleep-onset latency [39], and increased slow-wave sleep accumulation [92], which is related to the dissipation of the homeostatic sleep pressure [1, 14, 34]</b>." → light therapy helps with sleep onset!</li>
<li>"Also, the effects of evening light exposure do not seem to be independent from exposure during the preceding day. More specifically, Rångtell and colleagues [64] examined the effects of reading a novel on a tablet computer (~102 ± 41 lx, 7718 K) vs. in a physical book (~67 ± 50 lx, 2674 K) for two hours following prolonged (6.5 h) exposure to bright light (~569 lx, 3149 K) between 2:30 pm and 9 pm. Contrasting other findings, the light from the tablet did not suppress melatonin or alter subjective and objective sleep parameters. Note though that also exposure was shorter than in studies that reported significant effects [26, 72, 107]."</li>
<li>me there is a confound, people who have troubles sleeping will be more likely to use screen devices at evening or night.</li>
<li><b>BEST: dark therapy</b>: "Smartphone use may delay sleep onset. One factor is the light emitted by their screens, but another may also be its entertaining character or related psychological effects, or both. Using the “night shift” mode of modern smartphones, the colour balance of the screen can be shifted to “warmer” and orangeish colours depleted in short-wavelength light. On a recent iPhone 7, this amounts to a reduction of melanopsin activation by 67% at full display brightness. This might seem like a large reduction at first, though <b>by simply dimming the smartphone to its minimum level,</b> <b>the melanopsin activation can be reduced to less than 1% of the activation at maximum display brightness</b>."

<li>"<b>Mood variations</b> have been shown to be influenced by a <b>complex and non-additive interaction between circadian phase and the duration of prior wakefulness</b>. Specifically, relatively moderate changes in the timing of the sleep–wake cycle can significantly modulate mood [11]." "In addition to the circadian effects of light mediated via the SCN, a pathway from the retina to the habenula has recently been found to be involved in mediating effects of light on mood in animal models [38, 110]. This pathway, connecting some ipRGCs with the habenula and bypassing the SCN altogether, has been suggested to specifically mediate light-induced alterations in mood [38]." — <b>photic history</b></li>
<li>"The stabilising effects of light also make BLT a useful additional treatment in adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [69], borderline personality disorder [19], and other conditions characterised by sleep–wake disruption, such as schizophrenia [18] or neurodegenerative diseases [103]."</li>
<li>"For CRSWD, the timing of therapeutic light exposure depends on the type of circadian disturbance and the direction of phase shift (advance or delay) to be pursued in order to achieve circadian resynchronisation. Therefore, a reliable marker of circadian phase should be first assessed to identify the phase position and then determine the timing of light treatment. The gold standard for measuring circadian phase is obtained by quantifying the so-called dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), i.e. the time at which melatonin levels rise above baseline, indicating that melatonin secretion has started. However, implementing DLMO assessment in the clinical practice remains difficult due to the limited availability of equipped centres that perform melatonin analyses and the costs of this diagnostic procedure, which are currently not reimbursed by health insurances in most European countries."</li>
<li>"BLT is particularly effective when exposure to light occurs regularly, i.e. on a daily basis, for at least 30–60 min."</li>
<li>"Disease relapses due to lacking therapeutic adherence depend on the underlying pathological condition: while SAD may rapidly reappear after a short therapy break, isolated days without light therapy are unlikely to have any negative consequences on circadian rhythm stabilisation in CRSWD, if regular sleep-wake schedules are maintained."</li>

<li>"Retinal illuminance may also be modulated by squinting and the specific facial features,such asthe brow, nose, and eyelid position, of an individual [37]. Finally, the retinal image is displaced frequently by head, eye and trunk movements [38–40]."</li>
<li>"Human exposure to light has changed profoundly. In the US in the 1800s, it is estimated that 90% of the population worked outside. By 2001, Americans spent 87% of their wake hours indoors [41]. The consequences of this substantial shift are poorly appreciated and the consequences on human health and performance remain unclear."</li>
<li>"This ‘nesting’ of different neurophysiological processes and their entangled outcomes illustrates the complexity of separating indirect effects from direct effects. For this reason, it is a key challenge to develop methods of assessing the stability of the circadian system under different illumination patterns over extended periods of time (i.e. days and weeks)."</li>
<li>"Drawing an analogy to food, we refer to these patterns of light exposure as the ‘spectral diet’. The absolute spectral diet is the pattern of absolute spectral irradiance a human observer might receive over the course of a specific amount of time. The relative spectral diet refers to the spectral composition, or spectral quality, of the light received. Both absolute and relative spectral diets are important. The analogy to food diet here is the following: one might eat, over the course of the waking day, a fixed number of calories, for example, 2000 kcal. This number itself does not tell us how these 2000 kcal were spread across the different macronutrients. Similarly, an illuminance of 2000 lx received during daytime hours does not tell us how the different photoreceptors were affected by it."</li>
<li>"The spectral diet is not simply a characterisation of the spectral environment for its own sake but could potentially also lead to inferences about the properties that an ‘ideal’ – or statistically optimal – observer’s photoreceptive system should have (e.g. spectral tuning, or temporal filtering properties)."</li>
<li>See Fig 2</li>
<li>"A recent international standard (CIE S 026/E:2018) describes a retinally referenced framework for quantifying the effects of light from a given radiance or irradiance spectrum [53]. This standard, based on previous proposals[54], allowsfor the determination of the extent to which the L, M and S cones, the rods, and melanopsin are activated by a given spectrum. "</li>
<li>+ combine with: "Similar to invertebrate opsins, <b>melanopsin photopigment</b> is thought to function as <b>both a photoreceptor and photoisomerase</b> (33–35). That is, after activation of melanopsin by light, a different portion of the light spectrum regenerates the chromophore and restores melanopsin photosensitivity. Whereas melanopsin phototransduction is most sensitive to short-wavelength light, recent studies suggest that melanopsin photoisomerase activity may be more sensitive to longer-wavelength light (26,36,37). <b>We found, however, that exposure to 460 nm alone could maintain melatonin suppression for at least 6.5 h, despite the absence of exposure to any other wavelengths of light that could potentially interconvert ‘meta’-melanopsin back to its photosensitive form. Short-wavelength light may therefore be sufficient to elicit melanopsin photoisomerase activity, even if long-wavelength light is more efficient at restoring photoreceptor function.</b>" <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/</a></li>

<li><b>BEST: light therapy inhibits melatonin faster than natural endogenous synthesis cessation</b>: "Interestingly, the rate of melatonin suppression was significantly faster under both intermittent (t1/2 of ~13 min) and continuous (t1/2 of ~18 min) light exposure as compared to the rate of decrease in melatonin levels following the cessation of melatonin synthesis estimated as SynOff (t1/2 of ~56 min)45.

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL (amazing study): variation of color matters!

<li>ME: Keep in mind mice are nocturnal, so they prefer to live during the yellow period, whereas humans (and guina pigs) are diurnal so the effect is the opposite (blue light preference).</li>
<li>Fig1 &amp; 2: <b>Both blue AND yellow/amber color can impact the rhythm!</b> The more saturated the color, the more shift is observed. If no cycle in color during the day, the mice are freerunning, with a longer tau period and smaller sleep duration with more saturation!</li>
<li>BEST: Fig1.I suggests that once the mice were freerunning due to continuous monochromatic color exposure, they stayed in a non24 freerunning cycle!</li>
<li>"In summary, these data provide some support for the idea that color may aid entrainment to low-amplitude light dark cycles but suggest that, for robust entrainment, changes in light intensity greater than those achievable here are required."</li>
<li>"Instead, <b>a more globally relevant potential benefit of using color is to compensate for stochastic fluctuations in the diurnal rhythm of light intensity</b>, e.g., due to <b>variations in cloud cover</b> [11, 12]."</li>
<li>"Clouds can reduce ambient light levels by &gt;10-fold, rendering the timing of sunrise/sunset ambiguous for a system that relies simply on light intensity. The twilight blue shift, however, is retained irrespective of clouds [9, 10, 11]."</li>
<li>Confirmed: "Importantly, however, when we analyzed the day-day similarity of activity patterns (by calculating the mean pairwise correlations), we found a significant reduction under intensity-only days (Figure 4H), indicating that <b>daily activity timing was more variable in the absence of color signals</b>."</li>
<li>"<b>In summary, naturalistic diurnal variations in color confer enhanced robustness and stability to daily activity patterns in the face of weather-related fluctuations in light intensity.</b>"</li>
<li>"Specifically, interdaily stability was significantly reduced following intensity-only versus natural days (Figure 4E), and this effect was associated with <b>significant increases in the percentage of daily activity occurring outside the projected night</b> (Figure 4F), increased intradaily variability (Figure 4G), and a reduction in mean day-day correlation (Figure 4H). These data thereby confirm that naturalistic variations in color substantially enhance the amplitude and stability of clock-driven behavioral rhythms when the diurnal variation in light intensity provides unreliable timing information." → just like non24 having their brains staying active for too long!</li>
<li>"Indeed, direct investigations of human circadian resetting reveal that low-intensity, short-wavelength light (460 nm) produces smaller responses than longer wavelength light (555 nm) of equivalent melanopic illuminance [3]."</li>
<li>"A strong prediction of our research is that these changes in color may oppose any benefits obtained from modulating melanopsin photon capture. Recent work indicates that melanopsin-directed modulations that lack perceptible difference in color exert beneficial effects [45, 46]. Our data now suggest that supplementing such approaches with color changes of the appropriate direction could be especially effective at modulating circadian responses."</li>

<li>"In most subjects, exposure to 460 nm light elicited a relatively constant amount of melatonin suppression during the light exposure, whereas exposure to 555 nm light elicited an initially strong suppression of melatonin which gradually recovered to baseline values even in the continued presence of light (Fig. 1C) (12). [...] <b>indicating that short-wavelength light was much more effective than longer-wavelength light at suppressing melatonin</b> in the latter half of the 6.5-h light exposure." Fig1 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4414925/</a></li>
<li>"On the basis of this short-wavelength shift in spectral sensitivity, we hypothesize that cone photoreceptors provide for temporary suppression of the melatonin rhythm, whereas melanopsin signals light information continuously across long-duration exposure to light. Consistent with this interpretation, a blind individual with no detectable rod or cone function showed a constant level of melatonin suppression across a 6.5-h exposure to 460 nm light, whereas 555 nm light did not suppress melatonin at all (4)."</li>
<li>"In an article published while this study was in progress, the spectral sensitivity of human melanopsin cells was defined by examining sustained pupillary constriction after the offset of a light stimulus (25). <b>The fitted peak in spectral sensitivity was 482 nm</b>, which is consistent with the spectral tuning of melanopsin cells in the macaque and in lower mammals (8,20). Therefore, the 460 nm light stimulus that was used in the present study likely elicited strong, but sub-maximal, stimulation of the melanopsin cells. Similarly, although 555 nm light is best at stimulating the photopic visual system, which is dominated by middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive cones, short-wavelength-sensitive cones respond maximally to ~420 nm light and provide input to the melanopsin cells (20). Hence, the short-wavelength stimulus that we used does not provide for complete isolation of the melanopsin-driven response, and we cannot rule out the possibility that rod photoreceptors contributed to the responses."</li>
<li>"Based on the short-wavelength sensitivity of melanopsin, it has been hypothesized that phototherapy can be optimized by using predominantly short-wavelength blue light. Our results indicate that <b>short-duration (&lt;90 min) retinal exposure to narrow-bandwidth 555 nm light (≤24 lux) may be as effective, if not more effective, than an equivalent photon dose of 460 nm light (≤2 lux)</b>." → but ONLY if short-duration, because if session is too long, melatonin is progressively restored! And even if the green light is still on! Hence blue light more effective at suppressing melatonin!</li>
<li>SUMMARY: blue light is better at suppressing melatonin, but since melatonin suppression is not necessarily related to circadian rhythm shift, actimetry is way better to test activity and estimate the circadian rhythm. Both <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a> show that light can have an effect even without melatonin suppression, hence yellow light therapy may be as effective as blue light therapy, without melatonin suppression?</li>

<li>"Further analysis of these 15 reports indicated that a two-hour exposure to blue light (460 nm) in the evening suppresses melatonin, the <b>maximum melatonin-suppressing effect being achieved at the shortest wavelengths (424 nm, violet)</b>. The <b>melatonin concentration recovered rather rapidly, within 15 min from cessation of the exposure, suggesting a short-term</b> or simultaneous impact of light exposure on the melatonin secretion.

<li>"In addition, even the longest wavelengths (631 nm, red) and intermittent light exposures induced circadian resetting responses, and <b>exposure to low light levels (5–10 lux) at night when sleeping with eyes closed induced a circadian response</b>."</li>
<li>"Exposure to artificial light at night (ALAN) has been estimated to increase annually by 3–6% in past decades (Hölker et al. 2010) and continues to extend further in space, time, and intensity with more than 2% annual growth in radiance and extent (Kyba et al. 2017)."</li>
<li>"In addition to melatonin secretion, light exposure affects sleep-wakefulness cycle. Thus, as rapid-eyemovement (REM) sleep timing is controlled by the master circadian clock (Lee et al. 2009), the circadian rhythm disruption can also be detected by measuring REM sleep parameters with electroencephalogram (EEG)."</li>
<li>BEST: light impacts the circadian rhythm way more than sleep hygiene/having a fixed sleep schedule/chronotherapy: "Subjects kept their normal schedule for the first 5 days and received morning and evening light exposures the following 7 days in addition to a fixed sleep schedule (advanced by 90 min from the baseline). <b>The study showed that the direction of circadian phase change is determined by the light-dark exposure, not by the fixed sleep schedule, and that both morning and evening light exposures need to be controlled to shift circadian phase.</b> After 7 days on the fixed 90-min advanced sleep schedule, circadian phase advanced by 132 ± 19 min in advance group and delayed by 59 ± 7.5 min in delay group."</li>
<li>No difference in the response to light exposure between chronotypes: "No significant difference was found in the responses to light exposure between the two types of chronotypes. DLMO was significantly delayed after the delaying light exposure and significantly advanced after the advancing light exposure in both groups compared to the baseline week. The light-induced circadian phase changes were consistent with those predicted by previously published PRCs for both chronotypes. It was noted that light exposures of the subjects during the baseline weeks were significantly less than those during the weeks of light exposure."</li>
<li>BEST TOSEE: "<b>To a surprise, after wake-up in the morning, exposure to blue light (Crowley and Carskadon 2010; Sharkey et al. 2011) or blue-enriched light (Sander et al. 2015) for one hour was not effective in shifting the phase the circadian rhythm of melatonin. However, exposure to blue light, if administered with a sleep-advancing scheme (</b><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27449476" title="Geerdink et al. 2016" class="https">Geerdink et al. 2016</a><b>) or with a control of conflicting light exposure (Appleman et al. 2013; Figueiro et al. 2014), produced a phase shift of the circadian rhythm of melatonin as anticipated.</b>"</li>
<li>"This shifted the timing of the circadian clock without major alterations to sleep itself. Similarly, Figueiro and Rea (2012) showed <b>how light delivered through eyelids during one hour suppressed melatonin and phase shift DLMO.

<li>"As for the individual sensitivity to evening light exposures, Canton et al. (2009) <b>did not find differences between blue and brown iris colour in the magnitude of the effect, but Higuchi et al. (2008) showed that inter-individual difference in pupil area positively correlates with melatonin suppression</b>. Also, in the early pubertal and prepubertal phase, adolescents were significantly more sensitive to evening light that in the late pubertal or postpubertal phase, even at a low, 150 lux exposure level (Crowley et al. 2015)."</li>
<li>"For example, experimentally induced phase shifts of about one and a half hour had only a minimal effect on subsequent sleep propensity and architecture in healthy individuals (Carrier and Dumont 1995)."</li>
<li><b>BEST: inter-individual light sensitivity:</b> "Noteworthy, <b>individual melatonin levels were also found to respond very differently to light, as some individuals had suppressed melatonin at a typical room light conditions, whereas some individuals did not react to a moderate light exposure</b> (Santhi et al. 2012)."</li>
<li>dark therapy is necessary: "To avoid unwanted changes in the circadian phase or night-time sleep, light exposure in the evening and at night as well as in the morning needs to be controlled, as even the longest wavelengths (631 nm) or intermittent light exposures do induce circadian resetting responses."</li>
<li><b>BEST: confirmation that eyes closed is OK to start the light therapy</b>: "<b>The eyelid acts as a red-pass filter</b> (Zeitzer et al. 2014) <b>and transmits only approximately 3%–14% of light</b> (Robinson et al. 1991) in a wavelength-dependent manner. Thus, the retinal exposure of light depends on the status of the eyes (open, closed)."</li>

<li>"All light measurements were monitored with the Daysimeter light sensor (see the “Compliance” section for more information). This was done since not only morning light is of influence on our circadian system; it is the complete pattern of light exposure during the whole day that is responsible for phase-shifting effects (Appleman et  al., 2013; Burgess, 2013b). Especially low light levels in the evening are essential for an optimal phase advance."</li>

<li>Blue light maintains sleep integrity/efficiency better during phase advancing treatment than using another light: "These results <b>may indicate that participants in the amber group had less consolidated sleep</b> during the treatment period compared with subjects in the blue light group"</li>
<li><b>Photic history explanation:</b> "Light has dual effects on the output of melatonin. It regulates the phase of melatonin by resetting the SCN (Khalsa et al., 2003; Rüger et  al., 2006), and light suppresses melatonin concentrations when it is produced (Lewy et  al., 1980; Zeitzer et al., 2000), probably via inhibition of the activity of the B-adrenergic receptors (Cagnacci et  al., 1992). Therefore, the melatonin production could have been increased by 2 processes: either by an increase in the synchronization of single-cell firings in the SCN (Meijer et al., 1998, Masubuchi et al., 1999; Harb et al., 2014), and therefore in the amplitude of the underlying circadian oscillation, or by a increase in the sensitivity of the pineal gland to light signals, which may result in an upregulation of the B-adrenergic receptors."</li>
<li><b>Chronotherapy is often confounded with changes in light exposure:</b> "It has been found that sleep schedules alone can phase advance the melatonin rhythm (Gordijn et  al., 1999; Danilenko et  al., 2003; Sharkey et al., 2011). In a home setting, earlier sleep and wake times will also automatically result in an earlier light exposure pattern, which in turn will induce a phase advance. Yet, despite all the environmental influences of a home setting in the current study, additional blue light on top of the phase advancing sleep protocol turned out to be more effective in advancing DLMO than additional amber light. This can be explained only by the significant difference in the amount of short blue wavelengths in the morning in the blue light protocol (2306 melanopic lux from the device and 1485 blue lux measured by the Daysimeter between 0600 h and 1200 h) compared with the amber light protocol (70 melanopic lux from the device and 965 blue lux measured by the Daysimeter between 0600 h and 1200 h), since exposure to all other white light and blue light intensities during the day were not significantly different between the 2 groups."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL:</b> <b>Blue light increases melatonin production at the same time it phase advances it! Photic history is modulated by light color!</b> "In the blue light condition, the total area under the curve of the nighttime melatonin pattern was larger after treatment compared with baseline, while this was not the case in the amber light condition."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: DLMO goes back to the baseline time after treatment, so need to maintain treatment to stabilize DLMO in place</b>: "Despite the fact that the DLMO returned to baseline values at the last day of the protocol posttreatment, participants in the blue light therapy group still woke up about 30 min earlier compared with participants in the amber light group during the posttreatment period."</li>
<li>"Low daytime light levels are correlated with poor sleep quality scores (Leger et al., 2011; Boubekri et al., 2014), whereas increased light levels during the day are correlated with an improvement of sleep quality (Viola et al., 2008; Paul et al., 2015). It should be noted that most of these studies included only subjective sleep quality scores and that studies were either only correlational or, in case of an experimental setup, light intensity during the day was increased without paying attention to its timing."</li>
<li><b>BEST: Blue light therapy decreases the number of naps, increases sleep quality and avoids lengthening of sleep duration likely due to increased sleep fragmentation due to the phase advance chronotherapy + need to be in phase</b>: "During treatment, WASO and the number of sleep bouts were significantly increased and sleep efficiency was significantly decreased for participants in the amber group compared with baseline whereas they were not different in participants of the blue group. At the same time, sleep duration was increased in the amber group and not in the blue group. We speculate that <b>the longer sleep duration in the amber group is a consequence of the increased sleep fragmentation and that the increased sleep fragmentation resulted from the induced mismatch between sleep timing and melatonin secretion</b>: both groups were given the instructions to sleep 2 h earlier by the end of the treatment period, while the DLMO of the blue and amber group shifted for 84 and 48 min, respectively. In a study by Lazar and colleagues (2013), it was found that if the phase angle between the DLMO and habitual sleep onset is shorter, people have a higher insomnia score. In the present study, higher concentrations of melatonin were reached later in the amber group compared with the blue group, and the phase angle between DLMO and sleep was shorter."</li>
<li><b>Blue light increases vigilance, and with strongest effect directly at wake-up (when sleep inertia is the highest)</b>: "Blue light was more efficient in decreasing sleep inertia after waking up than amber light was. It is known that blue-enriched light is efficient in keeping humans alert (Hommes &amp; Giménez, 2015), especially during the night when sleepiness scores are high (Lockley et al., 2006; Rüger et al., 2006; Phipps-Nelson et al., 2009; Chellappa et al., 2011; Rahman et al., 2014). Because the effect is strongest at high sleepiness scores, one would expect that the effectiveness of blue light during the day would be highest directly after waking up. The results of the present study are indeed in line with this theory. They are also consistent with an earlier study of Revell and colleagues (2006), wherein they used light of different wavelengths and found that the alerting effect of light with 470 nm (blue light) is strongest directly after waking up."</li>

<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
<b>BUT blue light therapy doesn't help with performance, it's still suboptimal at wake-up because of mismatch with melatonin which reverts back to its previous state over time after treatment = brain fog</b>: "Performance was significantly worse in the morning in the posttreatment period, also for the blue light group. This may be explained by the changed phase angle between the melatonin rhythm and sleep phase after light therapy. The participants in the blue group still woke up earlier compared with baseline, while the timing of their melatonin rhythm was shifted back to the timing during the baseline period. This especially may have had consequences for performance in the morning, as the participants woke up too early in relation to their internal clock."

<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li><b>BEST: postprandial sleepiness = postprandial dip, and it's dependent on duration of prior awake period and circadian clock</b>: "The postlunch dip is dependent on an interaction between the duration of prior waking and the circadian clock (Bes et al., 2009)."</li>
<li>"<b>After treatment, the phase advance of the melatonin rhythm shifted back to the original values</b>, while sleep timing was still advanced after the use of blue light therapy. This confirms that blue light therapy was supportive in shifting the sleep phase more than amber light was. <b>Whether the discrepancy between the melatonin rhythm and sleep phase after light therapy is desirable is the question, as performance was worse during the morning after treatment in the blue light therapy group</b>. To investigate if performance can be stabilized and if the effects on sleep are long-lasting, more research should be done on longer (blue) light therapy protocols with voluntary sleep timing."</li>

<li>"The data support the conclusion that blue light was able to compensate for the sleep integrity reduction and to a large extent for the performance decrement that was observed in the amber light condition, both probably as a consequence of the advancing sleep schedule.

<li><b>BEST REVIEW: Light therapy: is it safe for the eyes?</b> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192</a>
<ul>
<li>"<b>Results suggest that light therapy is safe for the eyes in physically healthy, unmedicated persons.</b> The ocular safety of light therapy in persons with preexisting ocular abnormalities or increased photosensitivity warrants further study. However, theoretical considerations do not substantiate stringent ocular safety-related contraindications for light therapy."</li>
<li>"Previous research has shown that the blue range of visible light, particularly between 450 and 500 nm, has the strongest effect on the biological clock (19–24), as the photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells primarily involved in circadian regulation express melanopsin, a blue light-sensitive photopigment with a peak absorption of about 480 nm (25, 26)."</li>
<li>"Initially, light therapy was performed with light boxes that emitted skylight-like light. Later, ordinary white fluorescent light-emitting boxes were used, as research showed that <b>ultraviolet (UV) light was not required for antidepressant effects</b> (27)."</li>
<li>"To prevent side effects from looking into a light source (e.g., glare), persons are often advised to place a light source in a 45-degree angle with respect to the eyes and to avoid staring in the light, which leads to exposure of the peripheral retina as well."</li>
<li>ME: Ah I remember: the light in the Luminette is anyway way less than the sun, so no problem. And other white light lamps have blue light too.</li>
<li>"A study that compared two conditions that provided similar amounts of biologically effective radiation and therefore probably quite similar blue light hazards showed that the monochromatic blue low lux light condition produced more ocular complaints compared to the white high lux light condition (28). This may suggest that the monochromaticity of the light or light color may play a more important role in the occurrence of ocular complaints than the biologically effective irradiance and illuminance."</li>
<li>"A large epidemiological study found a higher level of exposure to blue light in persons with advanced AMD as compared to age-matched controls (73), and shorter wavelength visible radiation has been suggested to accelerate retinal aging (74, 75). The progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) may therefore be stimulated by light therapy. It can be questioned, however, whether light therapy significantly contributes to the blue light hazard already provided by the environment, as the levels used for light therapy fall well below the amount encountered on a sunny day outdoors (120 000 lux). Nonetheless, prolonged light therapy may provide a greater cumulative blue light hazard than is normally experienced by some people (37): Modern indoor lighting provides only 5% of natural light intensities (76, 77) and longer wavelength spectra (78), and exposure to natural light is strongly dependent on behavioural factors (79, 80). There is no evidence supporting the development or progression of retinal vascular disease, such as diabetic retinopathy, with increased light exposure (81). The etiology of these conditions differs from that of AMD and is primarily vascular, although a neurodegenerative component may play a role in diabetic retinopathy as well (82)."</li>

<li><b>IMPORTANT CRITICAL ME</b>: we assume that sleep time and wake up time are linked, they are one same process, but that may not be the case: it may very well be that triggering the endogenous melatonin production by exogenous melatonin pills intake may not change the time at which it stops. Hence, melatonin suppression at wake-up may be necessary, and complementary with melatonin, in order to gain full control of the endogenous melatonin production cycle, and hence some degree of control over the circadian rhythm. PREVIOUS NOTE: CRITICAL ME: My own sleep data<b> suggests that the wake up time is managed by an independent process, different from the fatigue process which governs bedtime, contrary to what we usually believe. So need to treat them separately.</b> In other words, getting to bed and even to sleep earlier does not make one wake up earlier, and waking up earlier does not make one sleeping earlier. Although of course both help each other and so are linked in some way (at least in terms of wakeful state duration which builds up adenosine and hence fatigue, but this can be counterbalanced by dopamine with sleep deprivation buildup), but the link between these processes is weaker than usually thought, they are not causative but correlative. One can be fixed without the other being fixed. Ideally, both should be fixed, but they are fixed using different methods since they are different processes.
<ul>
<li><b>CONFIRMED: melatonin suppression is decoupled (although correlated) with circadian phase shifting: we can phase shift without having a significant melatonin suppression, and inversely. There are other pathways than melatonin that light can stimulate, hence why light therapy is necessary:</b> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" class="https">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x</a></li>

<ul>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: also confirms that longer light exposure / photic history, intermittent or not (6.5h), produces way more phase shift than a smaller duration, whether or not there is more melatonin suppression.</b> Actually, intermittent bright light (IBL) for 6.5h produces almost as much phase shift as continuous, but virtually without melatonin suppression:
<ul>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image010.png"></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ME: this shows that light therapy devices are triggering other circadian resetting mechanisms apart from melatonin suppression (although there is a correlation between light exposure and melatonin suppression, but it's not the only way light can affect the circadian rhythm). That is a big discovery because it shows that melatonin is NOT doing everything about the circadian rhythm (so melatonin is NOT a 1-to-1 proxy for the circadian rhythm), and it's shedding some light as why melatonin intake is complementary to light exposure in the morning (and avoidance of light in the evening). Melatonin is not the circadian rhythm, but we don't have the technology to directly study the circadian rhythm, so researchers use melatonin profiles. But we need to see beyond, as this can explain observations of CRSWD people who can sleep at a variable time but wake up at the same time, or when they sleep earlier and longer but still end up waking up later and later as with the non-24 syndrome.</li>

<li>"circadian-clock disruption can promote alcohol consumption, which can further exacerbate this cycle. For example, Per2 mutant mice exhibit increased alcohol consumption compared with wild-type counterparts (Spanagel et al. 2005)"</li>
<li>"This may explain why humans with circadian disruption are more prone to substance abuse disorders (Trinkoff and Storr 1998)."</li>
<li>circadian disruption reduces the immune system: "In addition to genetically manipulating circadian homeostasis, environmentally disrupting circadian rhythms also negatively affects immune function. For example, loss of regular sleep/wake cycles alters the normal circadian rhythmicity observed in immune cells (Bryant et al. 2004; Vgontzas et al. 2004) and increases the susceptibility to infections (Everson 1993; Mohren et al. 2002). Indeed, chronically shifting light/dark cycles in mice augments LPS-induced immune response, resulting in greater mortality compared with non–circadian-disrupted mice (Castanon-Cervantes et al. 2010)."</li>
<li>"Eating is an environmental factor that selectively affects peripheral circadian rhythmicity in the intestine and liver. Feeding at the incorrect time (e.g., late-night eating for humans) can result in internal circadian misalignment. For example, restricted feeding paradigms in which animals only have access to food during inappropriate times (i.e., during the light cycle for nocturnal rodents) results in misalignment between central light-entrained circadian rhythms (i.e., in the SCN) and peripheral food-entrained circadian rhythms, including those in the liver (Damiola et al. 2000). Recent studies suggest that this internal misalignment scenario is linked to weight gain, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Indeed, mice fed during the inappropriate time gain more weight (Arble et al. 2009; Salgado-Delgado et al. 2010) than mice fed during appropriate time, despite similar activity levels and caloric intake (Arble et al. 2009). This phenomenon also is observed in humans; people who skip breakfast and have eating patterns shifted toward late-night eating tend to be more overweight than those who consume food during more appropriate time periods (Berkey et al. 2003; Ma et al. 2003).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Genetic abnormalities in the molecular circadian clock also are associated with metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes (Scott et al. 2008; Woon et al. 2007). For example, Clock mutant mice, which have disrupted circadian rhythms (Vitaterna et al. 1994), are obese and demonstrate characteristics of metabolic syndrome such as high cholesterol levels and high blood glucose (Turek et al. 2005). Bmal1 mutant mice also have disrupted circadian rhythmicity (Bunger et al. 2000), disrupted adipogenesis (Shimba et al. 2005), and demonstrate markers of metabolic syndrome (e.g., higher levels of triglycerides and glucose) (Marcheva et al. 2010; Rudic et al. 2004). Similarly, mutations in Cry genes disrupt hormonal rhythms (Fu et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2009) and Cry mutants show markers of metabolic syndrome (Okano et al. 2009).

<li>SUMMARY ME: <b>Melatonin should be provided if sleep issues for autistic people, because ASD may have circadian rhythm misalignments</b></li>
<li>44% to 83% of children and adolescents with ASD have sleep issues.</li>
<li>"Children and 13 adolescents with intellectual disabilities and severe symptoms associated with ASD are at especially high risk for sleep problems.5-7 14 Sleep disturbances are associated with communication deficits and restrictive and repetitive behaviors in ASD. 8, 9 15 Sleep disorders negatively affect sleep and quality of life of affected individuals and their families. 10 16 Disordered sleep is also associated with daytime behavioral disturbances, 11-13 increased injury risk, 14, 15 obesity, 16 17 and poor academic performance17-19 18 in general pediatric populations."</li>
<li>"<b>Contributors to circadian rhythm misalignment potentially include dysregulated melatonin synthesis or altered melatonin secretion patterns, circadian clock gene anomalies</b>, 20 21 and 22 decreased awareness of social and environmental clues that help habituate sleep–wake cycles. 23 Abnormalities in GABAergic, glutamatergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic systems in ASD 16 1 are also possible contributors. Coexisting conditions such as epilepsy, nocturnal 2 gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis, and 3 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) can further contribute to sleep problems. Core 4 or co-occurring ASD symptoms such as intellectual disability, sensory integration deficits, 5 ritualistic or self-injurious behaviors, poor communication skills, and limited responsiveness to 6 social cues can interfere with sleep training and exacerbate or prolong sleep problems."</li>

<li>"The magnitude of circadian regulation of metabolism is underscored by recent appreciation that <b>metabolism is an integral component in the mammalian circadian network</b>.55,63 More specifically, the molecular timekeeping mechanism within individual cells, known as the circadian clock, directly modulates multiple metabolic processes in a time-of-day-dependent manner, whereas fluctuations in metabolism act in a feedback manner, thereby modulating the clock mechanism (through changes in energy charge, ROS, redox status, acetylation, O-GlcNAcylation, etc).55,63 An added layer of complexity stems from appreciation that the responsiveness of the heart to a variety of factors known to modulate metabolism is similarly subject to circadian regulation (eg, insulin responsiveness).64,65 In many ways, metabolism can be considered a “moving target.”"</li>

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL NEW TREATMENT</b>: which resets molecular clocks, in the cells! It does a total phase reversal (ie, 12h phase delay). This is the only treatment we have to reset the circadian rhythm at the cellular/molecular level! A new study suggests that a synthetic form of cordycepin, a compound found in a cheap medicinal fungus C.militaris, can reset the circadian clock at the cellular level for up to 12 hours. "new study suggests that a <b>synthetic form of cordycepin</b>, a compound found in a medicinal fungus", "Cordycepin is the active ingredient in a fungus called <b>C. militaris</b>", "The difference is that C. militaris is much cheaper, and in turn, much easier to get.", "<b>In mice</b>, scientists found that synthetic cordycepin drastically helped the animals adjust to time change. Normally when mice are exposed to an 8 hour time change — imagine flying from New York to Abu Dhabi — <b>it would take them 10 days to adjust. The mice on cordycepin took only four days</b>.", "We want to let people know that drastic and quick changes for our body clock are possible," Zhang says." <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" class="https">https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769</a> and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound</a>

<li>Works equally well for phase delay and phase advance: "When they dosed mice with either 15mg/kg or 45 mg/kg of the synthetic cordycepin, <b>the mice were able to more easily able to adjust when they were forced to live in a "time zone" 8 hours earlier</b> than what they were used to, as compared to mice who did not receive the compound. <b>That same pattern held when the mice were put in a time zone 8 hours behind their own</b> (imagine flying from New York to Baker Island, an uninhabited island about halfway between Hawaii and Australia). "In both cases, <b>our drug administration shortened the adaptation time to at least one half</b>," says Zhang."</li>
<li>How it works? "The team found the synthetic cordycepin can bind to an enzyme called <b>RUVBL2</b>, and influence transcription of clock genes. These are genes when are turned "on" and "off" as the body goes through our 24-hour cycles.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
RUVBL2, importantly, was abundant in areas of the mouse brain like the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This is the light-sensitive area of the brain that is the master controller of our circadian rhythm.<br>
Cordycepin binds to RUVBL2, which creates a cascade of changes. First, a crucial protein is forced to leave chromatin, a structure that condenses DNA into packages (like a .zip does for images). Once that protein leaves, other genes related to the circadian rhythm, called E-box genes, are transcribed freely.<br>
Cordycepin can be thought of as a key that "unlocks" the ability to transcribe those genes. Once that happens, a new oscillation (or a cycle of 24 hours) begins. The clock is reset.<br>
Overall, Zhang theorizes that this <b>"magic drug can change the clock phase up to 12 hours."</b><br>
"A timed regulation of our internal body clock is possible.""

<li>"Our experiments also showed that <b>cordycepin has a short half-life, as the cordycepin concentration in the cells was very low 4 hours after administration</b> (Fig. 1E). The phase-shifting effect of cordycepin was <b>dependent on the time of administration</b>: The shape of the phase response curve following cordycepin administration showed <b>a strong phase-shift (&gt;6 hours)</b> phenotype, which is categorized as the <b>“type 0–resetting,”</b> where there is a discontinuity existing at the transition between phase advance and delay (Fig. 1F and data file S1) (23)."</li>

<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>Two definitions: either type 0 is considered absolute (no time-dependent effect depending on when it's taken in relation to the circadian rhythm) or it's more potent phase shift effect than type 1 (eg, type 1 is &lt; 6h delay, which can be due to environmental factors such as temperature or sample damaging, whereas type 0 &gt; 6h shift).</li>
<li>"Another possibility to synchronise circadian rhythms with their cyclic environment is if every zeitgeber stimulus – no matter when it is received – resets the rhythm to the same internal phase (e.g., to the beginning of the internal day). This type of resetting is called type 0." → cordycepin is a type 0 resetter, but theoretically any zeitgeber can become a type 0 resetter if intensity is sufficient</li>
<li>"Stable entrainment is achieved when a zeitgeber stimulus can shift the phase of the circadian rhythms each day by the exact amount that compensates the difference between the free-running period and that of the zeitgeber (normally 24 h)."</li>
<li>BEST: mentions "An Atlas of Phase Responses Curves for Circadian and Circatidal Rhythms" <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" title="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" class="https">https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/</a></li>
<li>Hence here for cordycepin, the definition of type 0 used is not of absolute resetter irrespective of administration time, but rather the latter definition that if the dosage is high enough, the resetting will be &gt;6h (a "phase reversal").</li>
<li><b>BEST ME: cordycepin is an adenosine analog, so it has more to do with the homeostatic process S, and yet it also controls the circadian rhythm C. Hence both processes are likely interdependent.</b></li>
<li>"RuvB-like ATPase 2 (<b>RUVBL2</b>) interacts with other known clock proteins on chromatin to regulate the circadian phase"</li>
<li>"Clock malfunctions result in sleep disorders and lead to other diseases (1–4), and <b>a recent study emphasized that circadian timing must be considered when clinicians select the dosage regime for a given medicine</b> (5). The eukaryotic clock consists of a core oscillator that regulates its own transcriptional activity via negative feedback, generating a roughly 24-hour rhythm in cells, tissues, and whole organisms (6). There are multiple associated transcriptional feedback loops that engage with the core oscillator to form a nested network that hierarchically regulates physiological rhythms throughout the organism (7, 8)"</li>
<li>"even fewer studies have examined the phase of the clock, which is very sensitive to environmental perturbations (10, 13). Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the phase may actually be equally, if not more, important for the clock than either the period or amplitude, as the phase of entrainment defines the regulatory control points for circadian transcription and determines the time at which the clock oscillation begins (14)."</li>
<li>BEST PROTOCOL of administration of cordycepin: 15mg/kg one day just before <b>current</b> wake up time, whether to phase advance or delay. Need to combine with light therapy ASAP: the same day as the injection, adapt the light/dark exposure to the new target phase, without any progressivity: "This adaption time to a phase advance was significantly shortened (P &lt; 0.001) to only 4 days when a cordycepin injection was administered at Zeitgeber time 11 (ZT11; light off 1 hour later at ZT12) on each of the first 2 days (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the cordycepin-treated mice adapted significantly faster (P &lt; 0.001) to an 8-hour phase-delay assay (Fig. 2B). Consistent with our results in cells highlighting the importance of cordycepin administration time, we also found that the mice did not show an accelerate behavioral phase-shift phenotype when cordycepin was injected at ZT23 (1 hour before light on; fig. S6)." → hence, no need to time according to target wake up time but rather to current wake up time, as cordycepin seems to break the circadian regulatory feedback loops, so then essentially your body won't know when is the wake up time anymore, and hence will pick up any zeitgeber to synchronize asap.</li>

Yes that would be correct, but <b>you only need to take cordycepin once</b>, not everyday. Your circadian rhythm would use the next days to progressively pick up on the new zeitgeber cycle, without needing any additional cordycepin.

Let me recap what I understand from the study and what additional infos I could gather:
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
[In the study](<a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" class="https">https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769</a>), they screened several molecules to find one that is a type-0 resetter, in other words (and according to their definition), a circadian phase reversal drug, which means it can shift the circadian rhythm of more than 6h.

</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
They found that only <b>adenosine analogs</b> are type-0 resetters, among those being Cordycepin.

Adenosine is the molecule that is the basis of the homeostatic sleep pressure process S. It's interesting, because according to Borbély's model, the process S is separate from the circadian rhythm process C (mainly regulated with melatonin), and numerous biological experiments have shown evidence of existence for both processes. However, some recent experiments show [an interdependent relationship between both processes](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154</a>), as indeed melatonin has [a weak effect on the process S but stronger on process C](<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" title="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" class="https">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know</a>) as melatonin interacts with both melatonin type 1 and type 2 receptors, the latter being more implicated with process C and type 1 with process S (see [here](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/</a>) and [here](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/</a>)) and on all cells notably [through the mitochondria](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7211589/</a>), and [light was also found to have an effect on both processes C and S](<a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" class="https">https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094</a>) too. So we here have a drug working theoretically on the homeostatic process S which is much more efficient than any other known drug including melatoninergic, which is thought to be the basis of the circadian process C.

What did they find in the study? They tested a jet lag model on mice: they injected 15 mg/kg of cordycepin (not 45mg/kg, that's for the next tests) to mice roughly 1h before wake-up on the first day, and then nothing apart from changing the light exposure. The mice needed half less time to adapt their circadian rhythm, and were better adapted, than mice without cordycepin, for both 8h phase advance and phase delay.

If we transposed to humans, the typical scenario would be when you prepare for a flight to another timezone. On the day of the flight, you wake up 1h earlier than your usual wake up time using an alarm clock, then take the appropriate dosage of cordycepin <b>only once</b>. Then you proceed with your day and take your flight to the new timezone. The Cordycepin you took in the morning would then <b>desynchronize</b> your circadian rhythm, so that you can pick up a new cycle fitting the new timezone faster. The new light exposure schedule will be changed when arriving in the new timezone, and your body will use this zeitgeber to pick up the new cycle faster thanks to the forced desynchrony by the cordycepin, which will hopefully allow your circadian rhythm to adapt to the new timezone in about half the time needed without cordycepin. This is super fast, and is why the [authors qualify the drug as "magic"](<a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/cure-for-jetlag-fungus-compound</a>).

<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So that's all nice and all, but is it working on humans? Well, they did not test on humans per se, but they did test on human cells in vitro. That's where they tested between 15mg/kg to 45mg/kg, at different timing, and found that the circadian phase resetting effect of cordycepin does happen with human cells, up to 12h (whereas they only tested 8h with mice), and is time dependent (eg, they tested giving cordycepin 1h before sleeping instead of wake up and it didn't work).
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
So that's very promising! But there is an issue: the dosage. Indeed, 15mg/kg of cordycepin as they gave to the mice equals to ~1g for a human weighting 70kg. [This study](<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp" title="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp" class="https">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228479929_Determination_and_analysis_of_cordycepin_and_adenosine_in_the_products_of_Cordyceps_spp</a>) shows that we can expect ~1mg of cordycepin per 1g of mycelium of cordyceps (the mushroom), whether militaris (cheaper) or sinensis (more expensive). In fact, in the fruiting body of cordyceps militaris, we can expect 2.6mg/g of cordycepin/cordyceps, so given militaris is much more affordable, this can be very interesting cost-wise.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
&gt; The mean contents of cordycepin and adenosine in the fruiting bodies of C. militaris were 2.654 ± 0.02 and 2.45 ± 0.03 mg/g, those in C. sinensis were 0.9801 ± 0.01 and 1.643 ± 0.03 mg/g, while those in the mycelium of C. militaris were 0.9040 ± 0.02 and 1.592 ± 0.03 mg/g, respectively. The concentration of cordycepin and adenosine in the fruiting bodies of C. militaris were higher than that in natural C. sinensis, while the fermented mycelium of C. militaris were similar with natural C. sinensis.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Since we assume we need 1g of cordycepin on average for a human to get the circadian phase resetting effects, this means we would need to ingest (and digest!) ~1kg of mycelium of cordyceps, or 377g of fruiting body of cordyceps militaris since it has a higher content. This seems a bit too much for the human body to realistically digest, so likely cordycepin should be obtained in an extracted pure powder form. Also, maybe a lower quantity is needed, the translation from mice to human is not linear so we may need much less for the same effect (or we may need more...).
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
But can it work with oral administration? As the study's authors note, cordycepin passed the blood-brain barrier. Also, it's maybe not necessary to attain the brain, because the cordycepin effect is on the circadian clocks of all cells (and [the pineal gland is not necessary for entrainment](<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a>)). [Another study ](<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found" class="https">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52254-x)found</a> that oral cordycepin, despite not being fully metabolized, does still generate a metabolite called 3′-deoxyinosine which may explain why oral cordycepin may work on adenosine pathways.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Now the question is whether it's safe or not? Has any previous safety clinical trial been conducted on humans with these dosages of cordycepin?
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Well, here we enter into a more muddy territory, as cordycepin is almost a religious substance in some cultures, so it's pretty difficult to get reliable independent and robust studies on its effects and safety profile. But some exist.

<li>ME: To summarize, without changing anything else in her life, an elder woman who was a typical sleeper saw a phase delay of 6 hours simply because of light exposure in the evening for a week. That's about a 1h delay per day, a similar quantity observed in what is considered among the most extreme cases of non24. With light alone. That's crazy.</li>
<li>ME: BEST: they were already using very long light therapy since it was 4h each evening!</li>

<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>

<li>"there are roughly 100 times more genes in the human microbiome than in the human genome.

<li>" A growing number of studies now suggest that the vast and diverse microbial ecosystem of the gut has its own daily rhythms.

<b>The rhythms of gut microbes are affected by diet, both the timing of our eating and the composition of the foods we consume.</b> A recent study found that mice eating a healthy diet generated more beneficial gut microbes, and that the collective activity of microbial life in the gut followed a daily—or diurnal—rhythm. That rhythm, in turn, supported circadian rhythms in the animal. Mice fed a high-fat, stereotypically “Western” diet, on the other hand, produced less optimal microbial life. The gut microbes of these mice did not adhere to a daily rhythm themselves, and also sent signals that disrupted circadian rhythms. These mice gained weight and became obese, while the mice that ate healthfully did not.

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Scientists bred a third group of mice without any gut microbes at all. These mice had no signals to send from a gut microbiome. Circadian disruption occurred in these mice—but they did not gain weight or suffer metabolic disruption, even when fed the high-fat diet. This suggests a couple of important conclusions. First, that microbial activity is key to normal circadian function—and therefore to sleep. Second, that the microbiome is a key player along with diet in the regulation of weight and metabolism.

However, in consideration of the identification of melatonin in prokaryotic bacteria [8], from which mitochondria evolved (the endosymbiotic theory) and the uncommonly high levels of assayable melatonin in mitochondria [9], it was speculated and eventually documented that this indoleamine is synthesized in this organelle [10]. Given that most cells (a few exceptions) contain <b>mitochondria</b>, <b>it is now believed that melatonin production occurs in most cells in all organisms</b>. This has also been specifically demonstrated in <b>human lung monocytes/macrophages</b> [11]. [...] Aerobic glycolysis is an important feature of highly proinflammatory state since it ensures the necessary high levels of ATP and the abundant supply of biomolecules to ensure synthesis and release of the damaging molecules that constitute the cytokine storm. This increased aerobic glycolysis coupled with the absence of locally-produced melatonin provides the optimal environment (the perfect “cytokine storm”) for the massive tissue damage that occurs in COVID-19 disease.

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: melatonin is a rhythm stabilizer/sleep consolidator?</b> Not a phase shifter (use light therapy for that)? "However, if animals were subjected to an abrupt phase shift (as in jet lag), they adapted faster to the new schedule without a pineal gland (56, 57). <b>This suggested that the pineal, and by inference melatonin, acted as a brake on abrupt changes of phase, these being undesirable in a natural environment.</b> This possibility is reinforced by the fact that suppression of melatonin production by the beta blocker atenolol leads to faster adaptation to light-induced phase-shifts in humans (58). Ironically therefore whilst exogenous melatonin is used to hasten adaptation, it is possible that a function of endogenous production is to do the opposite. [...] The accumulated knowledge on the deleterious effects of abruptly changing time cues in for example shift work and jet lag [e.g., (61–67)] lead to the <b>suggestion that one function of endogenous melatonin is to protect against abrupt short term changes of phase by maintenance of the circadian status quo.</b>" → See also: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589" class="https">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945707003589</a></li>

<li>BEST: circadian syndrome again: "<b>In humans in one study, the decrease in glucose tolerance from morning to evening was mostly influenced by the endogenous circadian system compared to the sleep-wake cycle.</b> However, in apparent contrast to pinealectomy effects in animals, <b>melatonin administered during day time just prior to a glucose tolerance test in healthy adults clearly impaired glucose tolerance both in the morning and the evening</b> (172, 173), an effect that was dependent on a common gain-of-function variant of the melatonin receptor gene MTNR1B151 (see below). <b>Melatonin may also acutely decrease insulin secretion in cultured human islets</b> (174). Thus, some controversy exists in the literature especially when comparing results in nocturnal rodents with diurnal humans with both beneficial and detrimental effects of melatonin reported. It is intriguing to note that the rare condition 'familial insulin resistance' or Rabden-Mendenhall syndrome is associated with pineal hyperplasia (175, 176)."</li>

<li>"Prolonged exposure of human subjects to a long-night, short-day cycle results in changes in the profile of some circadian rhythms including the melatonin rhythm and slightly increased duration and redistribution of sleep (3, 41). These findings are reminiscent of the effects of photoperiod in other mammalian species (42, 43). In our study, 9 d of exposure to 16-h sleep opportunities did not produce photoperiodic changes in melatonin duration. Comparing these data with those of Wehr and colleagues (3), it may be suggested that the length of time required to observe human photoperiodic responses is between 9 d and 4 wk. Alternatively, it is possible that the sample size used in the present study was not sufficient to detect statistically significant human photoperiodic responses."</li>
<li>"A previous study showed that <b>long-term melatonin administration (1 month, 6 mg) to six healthy male subjects did not alter mean nocturnal LH, FSH, testosterone, and inhibin-Beta secretion</b> (44)."</li>
<li>It's prolonged release melatonin that was used here, not instantaneous release melatonin: "A surge-sustained release capsule containing melatonin (1.5 mg) was used in the present study to achieve high circulating levels for at least the duration of the sleep opportunity (16 h) at close to physiological levels."</li>
<li>"In summary, these findings provide unequivocal evidence that, in the short term, timed melatonin treatment in suitable conditions is a highly effective means of phase-shifting circadian rhythms, without indication of deleterious effects on major aspects of human endocrine function, or daytime sleepiness and mood on the day following administration."</li>

<li>BEST CRITICAL: Melatonin desensitizes endogenous MT2 melatonin receptors in the rat suprachiasmatic nucleus: relevance for defining the periods of sensitivity of the mammalian circadian clock to melatonin. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910</a>
<ul>
<li>"This study demonstrated that pretreatment with physiological concentrations of melatonin (30-300 pM or 7-70 pg/mL) <b>decreased the number of hMT2 melatonin receptors</b> heterologously expressed in mammalian cells in a <b>time and concentration-dependent manner</b>."</li>
<li>"The decrease in MT2 melatonin receptor number induced by melatonin (300 pM for 1 h) was <b>reversible</b> and reached almost full recovery <b>after 8 h</b>; however, after treatment with <b>10 nM melatonin full recovery was not attained even after 24 h</b>. This recovery process was partially protein synthesis dependent."</li>
<li>"We conclude that in vivo the <b>nightly secretion of melatonin desensitizes endogenous MT2 melatonin receptors in the mammalian SCN thereby providing a temporally integrated profile of sensitivity of the mammalian biological clock to a melatonin signal</b>."</li>
<li>MY SUMMARY: endogenous and exogenous melatonin desensitizes the MT2 melatonin receptors (melatonin type 2), hence if the dosage is too big or the timing incorrect, not only melatonin will be ineffective but also it will be counterproductive and may prevent from sleeping! Hence analogously to the photic history, there is a melatonin history, in other words a dependency over past exposures in the last 24h mostly but also a bit in the previous days depending on the dosage.</li>

<li>BEST: melatonin dosage: "In 2001, researchers at MIT concluded that the correct dosage for melatonin falls between .3 and 1 mg. Yet, walk down the pharmacy aisle and you’ll see stacks of sleep aids packing as 10 times that amount."</li>
<li>Source study: <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2001/melatonin-1017" title="https://news.mit.edu/2001/melatonin-1017" class="https">https://news.mit.edu/2001/melatonin-1017</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013</a> Melatonin Treatment for Age-Related Insomnia, 2001</li>
<li>"The researchers also discovered that the typical health food store dosage of melatonin, which is about three milligrams (or 10 times the dosage in the study), is less effective in treating insomnia. In addition, the <b>higher dosage can cause</b> potentially serious side effects, including <b>hypothermia</b> (low body temperature). The study also showed that the higher dosage elevated plasma melatonin levels during the day, <b>which can cause a "hangover" effect in some of the subjects</b>."</li>
<li>But this was in older adults, who have lower melatonin levels, and was aimed at treating "age-related insomnia".</li>
<li>"We examined the ability of similar, physiological doses to restore nighttime melatonin levels and sleep efficiency in insomniac subjects over 50 yr old. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, subjects who slept normally (n = 15) or exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency (n = 15) received, in randomized order, a placebo and three melatonin doses (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg) orally 30 min before bedtime for a week. Treatments were separated by 1-wk washout periods."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "The physiologic melatonin dose (0.3 mg) <b>restored sleep efficiency</b> (P &lt; 0.0001), <b>acting principally in the midthird of the night</b>; it also elevated plasma melatonin levels (P &lt; 0.0008) to normal. The pharmacologic dose (3.0 mg), like the lowest dose (0.1 mg), <b>also improved sleep</b>; however, it induced hypothermia and caused plasma melatonin to remain elevated into the daylight hours. Although control subjects, like insomniacs, had low melatonin levels, their sleep was unaffected by any melatonin dose." → <b>in other words: melatonin helps to avoid fragmented sleep (melatonin consolidate/stabilize sleep), so that the subject does not wake up too early, and hence reduce the need for naps (which I suspect is a primary characteristic of non24). And whatever the dosage of melatonin. So it's a main effect of melatonin (as suspected by Josephine Arendt, it's a sleep stabilizer, and not a zeitgeber, in other words melatonin avoids too big and abrupt shifts in the circadian rhythm).</b></li>
<li><img src="./SleepNon24_files/pasted_image013.png" width="300"></li>
<li>BEST: age-related insomnia (or rather circadian rhythm disorder) is common! "AGING ALTERS THE regulation of sleep in many individuals (1–3): <b>about 30% of people over age 50 yr exhibit insomnia</b> characterized by decreased total nocturnal sleep time; frequent nocturnal awakenings with difficulty falling back asleep; and early morning awakening. These alterations are associated with increased daytime sleepiness, attention or memory deficits, and changes in mood."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "and <b>melatonin’s ability to restore sleep is, as has been suggested (17), related to the production of hypothermia</b>." → melatonin affects the circadian rhythm directly since it can modulate core body temperature!</li>
<li>BEST: "This change in overnight sleep efficiency was principally due to increased sleep efficiency during <b>the middle portion of the nocturnal sleep period (P = 0.018) and, secondarily, to improvement during the latter third of the night (Fig. 2)</b>. The sleep efficiencies of insomniac subjects <b>were normal during the first third of the night and were unaffected by melatonin during this interval</b>. Melatonin had <b>no behaviorally significant, dose-related effects on total sleep time; number of awakenings; latency to sleep onset; latency to REM sleep; or percent time spent in any of the sleep stages</b> in insomniacs or normal sleepers."</li>
<li>"that physiologic doses of melatonin that raise plasma melatonin to levels within its normal nocturnal range (i.e. 60–200 pg/ml) can significantly improve sleep in people suffering from age-related insomnia; that <b>bedtime melatonin treatment does not modify sleep efficiency or alter sleep architecture in older people in whom sleep already is normal</b>; and that the major effect of the melatonin treatment we provided is observed during the midportion of the nocturnal sleep period."</li>
<li>"<b>insomnia</b> was defined as exhibiting less than <b>85% sleep efficiency</b> (i.e. <b>the ratio of total sleep time to sleep period</b>) <b>or having a total sleep time of less than 6 h during at least three of the seven nights of the evaluation period</b>. Those qualified as normal sleepers had no subjective complaints of sleep alterations and had actigraphically defined sleep efficiencies not less than 90% and total sleep times of at least 7 h per night."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL ME: this would go along my theory that napping is a primary characteristic of non-24, and hence why melatonin is necessary for non24: not so much to phase advance the circadian rhythm, although it helps, but mostly to help in having a full night by reducing the amount of wake-ups in the 2nd part of the night from the middle.</b> This also fits with F data (properly timed and bright light allows to be entrained, but not to have consistently a full night).</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "A significant increase in circulating melatonin levels was detected within an hour of ingesting the hormone; median (interquartile range) peak levels, observed on average within 2 h of treatment, were 84 (59–120) pg/ml, 220 (124–299) pg/ml, or 1370 (957–2440) pg/ml after administration of the 0.1-, 0.3-, or 3.0-mg doses, respectively (Fig. 3). Ten hours after bedtime plasma melatonin levels after ingestion of the 0.1- or 0.3-mg doses were not significantly different from those observed after placebo treatment. However, <b>melatonin levels after ingestion of the 3-mg dose remained significantly elevated through much of the following day</b> (Fig. 3). <b>Administration of the 0.1- or 0.3-mg melatonin doses failed to modify the physiologic nocturnal decline in core body temperature; however, the 3-mg dose significantly lowed the group minimum core body temperature</b> (P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. 4)."</li>
<li><b>→ SUMMARY ME CRITICAL: melatonin affects under 1 hour of exogenous melatonin intake, but peak 2h later (hence why need to take 2-4h before DLMO for phase advance), and only high dosage can modify core body temperature (modify Tmin) but at the expense of residually elevated melatonin levels the next day at least, which may produce long term desensitization. THEORY: with high dosage, we risk desensitization, but we may be able to fully control the melatonin profile (and core body temperature), at the expense of being completely reliant on exogenous melatonin. Proof that suggests that's the case: high dosage melatonin produces a hang-over with hypothermia as shown in this study, this explains why high dosage melatonin causes one to sleep longer than necessary! (also </b><a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="this study" class="https">this study</a><b> recommend the same: to use high dosage for more efficiency, unless hang-over needs to be avoided).</b></li>
<li>"pharmacological doses of melatonin do not increase the sleep-promoting effects of melatonin above those achieved by physiological doses and might even be less effective" → WRONG: only the highest dosage 3mg had an impact on the core body temperature, which is a way better marker of the circadian rhythm than melatonin profile! Their study used sleep efficiency as a proxy for results on sleep, but they did NOT study the effect on phase advance and the circadian rhythm, so for the treatment of CRSWD (especially if treatment resistance), high dosage may be useful, this study says nothing about that!</li>
<li>"Excess melatonin can also induce <b>hypothermia, as body temperatures reduce during melatonin release</b>" <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-dark-side-of-melatoni_b_8855998" title="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-dark-side-of-melatoni_b_8855998" class="https">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-dark-side-of-melatoni_b_8855998</a></li>

<li>"Very high doses <b>may also desensitize</b> melatonin’s receptors in the brain, subsequently diminishing melatonin’s efficacy in promoting sleep." → hypothesis, no proof. In fact, all doses desensitizes dynamically the MT2 receptors.</li>
<li>Up to 2mg probably ok, unlikely to lead to desensitization: "Or they might try one of the sustained-release melatonin preparations generally available, which purportedly provide a high enough total dose <b>(e.g. 1.0 or 2.0 mg16,17) to elevate plasma melatonin for most of the night, but probably not so much as would produce desensitizing peak levels</b>." → Valdispert 1.9mg likely won't produce desensitization even (if desensitization can really happen).</li>
<li>"As described above, <b>the markedly elevated melatonin levels also can desensitize the MT1 and MT2 receptors in brain on which melatonin acts12–14</b> e.g. to promote sleep, quite possibly causing some users to become refractory to the beneficial effects of the melatonin they take4 or their own pineal glands secrete."</li>
<li>BEST: MT1 receptor not desensitized by usual doses of exogenous melatonin, but MT2 is desensitized at any dosage, even physiological/endogenous ones! "Exposure to melatonin can cause the prolonged desensitization of both of its receptors: <b>MT1 receptors require supraphysiologic melatonin concentrations to become internalized</b>12,13 —and thus unresponsive—but the <b>MT2 receptor transiently becomes desensitized even after exposure to the melatonin concentrations occurring normally at nighttime</b>.14 It can be speculated that MT2 receptor desensitization provides a feedback mechanism that limits the neural effects of nighttime melatonin concentrations, and that <b>too-high doses of supplemental melatonin will desensitize both MT1 and MT2 receptors, thereby paralyzing any contribution of the melatonin system to sleep until normal receptor sensitivity has been restored.</b>13,15"</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: why melatonin is different from sleeping pills, because it does not affect GABA receptors, and hence does not affect REM sleep nor the distribution of sleep stages:</b> "Both are mediated by its activation of two specific melatonin receptors, known as MT1 and MT2, on the surface of brain neurons that are concentrated within the suprachiasmatic nucleus, (which is also known to control sleep and circadian rhythms1). <b>The melatonin receptors differ from those for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through which most hypnotic agents act. This difference probably explains why, unlike the GABA-agonist drugs, which are true ‘sleeping pills,’ melatonin does not suppress REM sleep nor, in general, affect the distribution of sleep stages.</b>1,4"</li>

<li>0.3 mg is same levels as endogenous melatonin levels (in elder adults), 1mg is above (supraphysiological). "Melatonin blood levels following administration of an oral dose of 0.3 mg reach approximately the same levels as seen endogenously in humans at night [41]. However, <b>in humans, doses of melatonin from 1 mg and up will increase the blood levels several times above physiological plasma melatonin levels</b> [41]." — done on younger adults, ref 41 = <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8127888/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8127888/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8127888/</a>
<ul>
<li>BEST: high doses of melatonin (10-240mg) can impair mood and performance: "Thus, Lieberman et al. (13) found that a dose (240 mg over a 2-h period) that raised serum melatonin levels several thousandfold impaired mood and performance. More recently, we found similar behavioral changes after a considerably lower dose of the hormone (10 mg), which still raised serum levels to 40-50 times the normal nocturnal level (i.e., 4072 pg/ml; ref. 14)."</li>
<li>BUT: done during the day, when natural melatonin levels should be super low! So it doesn't give any clue about whether &gt; 1mg is causing supraphysiological levels when taken at night time, for that we need a study with melatonin intake at night AND measuring melatonin throughout the night and a bit of the next day to see if the levels return to normals!</li>
<li>So the best evidence for this supraphysiological threshold of melatonin &gt; 1mg is the 2001 study figure 3: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013</a> - but on elder adults with age-related insomnia and hence with already pathologically lower melatonin levels than younger adults!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"exposure to supraphysiological concentrations of melatonin (100 nM) causes an increase in MT1 receptor density, with a concurrent decrease in affinity and functional sensitivity [39]. <b>While the desensitization is significant, no internalization or loss of MT1 melatonin membrane receptors in CHO cells is observed [39].</b> This observation <b>differentiates the effects of melatonin on MT1 from that on MT2</b>, which has a completely different response to <b>acute exposure to high concentrations or prolonged exposure to physiological concentrations</b> (Fig. 7)."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: "<b>Desensitization and/or internalization of MT2 melatonin receptors affects the melatonin-mediated phase shift of circadian rhythms [40]. [...] </b>Interestingly, concurrent exposure of the SCN brain slice to both melatonin and the MT2 antagonist 4P-PDOT blocks the functional desensitization of MT2 receptors [40]." → [40] is the study above: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15522910</a></li>
<li>"Given the <b>potential involvement of MT2 receptors in phase shifting circadian rhythms in mammals, persistent desensitization of this receptor may make use of supraphysiological levels of melatonin counterproductive for treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders.</b>"</li>
<li>BEST: "The interplay between desensitization and/or internalization of MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptors to daytime and nighttime physiological concentrations of melatonin may promote changes in melatonin receptor function throughout the human circadian cycle [40]. With the SCN ultimately controlling the production of melatonin in the pineal gland, <b>a feedback loop is created that may use melatonin as the regulatory control of SCN firing and phase shifting functions.</b>" → Goes back to Josephine Arendt's theory that melatonin may be a feedback control system to be a rhythm stabilizer!</li>
<li>Both MT1 and MT2 receptors can phase shift, although it's more clear with MT2, a role for MT1 cannot be excluded. For now, we aren't sure what are the respective roles of both receptors. ME: link this back to mutations in the MT2 receptor with metabolic disorders and glucose/insulin interaction.</li>

<li>ME: "Also interestingly, the optimal time depends on the dosage of melatonin (and I guess the individual's sensitivity to melatonin). <b>With 5mg (stronger dose), you can take it 2h before DLMO, whereas for 0.5mg (lower dose) it had the most effect when taken 4h before DLMO.</b> And interestingly again, when each dose was taken at their respective optimal point, the amount of phase advance was the same (a bit more than 1h, similarly to van Geijlswijk's paper)." → both dosages produce similar phase advance if properly timed, so this also suggests that there is no desensitization (note that the study was over 2 sessions of 3 days each!)</li>
<li>"Alternatively, it is possible that by timing the administration of a single melatonin pill per day, at the same clock time, we may have not observed the maximum advance and delay that each melatonin dose can produce. This is because, after the first melatonin pill, the circadian clock and associated melatonin PRC likely shifted, meaning that the second and third pills fell on slightly different parts of the melatonin PRC. <b>Thus, a fixed administration time would exclude the possibility of all three melatonin pills falling exactly on the peak advance or peak delay portions of the melatonin PRCs.</b> Nonetheless, in 3 d we did observe larger maximum advances than those seen after a single melatonin dose of 0.5 mg (0.7 h in Ref. 10) and 5 mg (0.4 h in Ref. 12 ; 0.7 h in Ref. 13). <b>Future studies that incorporate such a gradually shifting time of melatonin administration (e.g. Ref. 14) are needed to determine whether in optimal circumstances larger supraphysiological doses of exogenous melatonin can in fact produce larger phase shifts</b>."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: how to calculate the optimal timing for exogenous melatonin intake:</b> "Although the DLMO is widely regarded as the most reliable circadian phase marker currently available (8, 15), it is not yet readily accessible to the general public. Thus, when the timing of an individual’s DLMO is not known, PRCs that are plotted relative to the DLMO (3, 4, 16) <b>must be translated to be relative to sleep times</b>. For example, because the Lewy 0.5 mg PRC indicates that peak advances occur about 3 h before the DLMO (see curve fit in Fig. 1 in Ref. 17), we previously administered 0.5 mg of melatonin 5 h before bedtime, assuming that there was 2 h between the individual’s DLMO and bedtime (18). <b>However, there is variability in the DLMO-to-bedtime interval. In a large sample, we found that the mean DLMO-to-bedtime interval was 2.7 h, and the range varied from −0.3 to 5.8 h (19). Indeed, 60% of the sample had a DLMO-to-bedtime interval outside of 2–3 h.</b> Therefore, to increase the practicality of our PRCs, we have replotted them relative to sleep midpoint (Figs. 3 and 55). <b>These PRCs show that maximum advances occur when 0.5 mg is taken about 10 h before sleep midpoint and when 3.0 mg of melatonin is taken about 11 h before sleep midpoint.</b> <b>Maximal delays occur when it is taken near the end of sleep and in the morning. We recommend that when the DLMO is known, PRCs plotted relative to the DLMO should be used instead of PRCs plotted relative to sleep midpoint. This is because bed and wake times are more readily influenced by social factors and can vary greatly between weekends and weekdays. Sleep midpoint may approximate circadian phase better than bedtime or wake time, but probably not as well as the DLMO.</b>"</li>

<li>"<b>In younger adults, it is amply proven that low exogenous doses of melatonin, even above 0.3 mg, produce supra-physiological levels</b> [16, 20–22, 26–30, 35] as well as in older adults [33]. When melatonin is administered in older adults, a higher variance of serum melatonin levels than in younger subjects can seen (76–486 vs. 142–205 pg/ml in the younger group; p\0.0001) [31]. Besides this, the maximum concentration reached after melatonin administration has a tendency to be higher in older age [31, 45, 46], and the increment is also greater and more variable amongst people aged over 48 years [31]. Our review round a small but significant relation between age and pharmacokinetic parameters (difference in Cmax and t1/2) [36], but in contrast, other studies failed to find such a relation between higher age and t1/2 [5, 32]. Second, we also demonstrated that higher doses of exogenous melatonin cause prolongation of elevated melatonin levels. <b>Gooneratne et al. [5] showed that a higher dose in a 75 % sustained-release formulation (4 mg) compared with a lower dose (0.4 mg) caused significant prolongation of elevated melatonin levels lasting throughout the morning hours and during the day.</b> Also, Zhdanova et al. [44] found that melatonin levels in the high-dose group (3 mg) were maintained above a set threshold for longer than in the low-dose groups (0.1 and 0.3 mg). <b>This implies that a higher maximum dose carries the risk of prolongation of supra-physiological levels in older adults throughout the next day.</b> This might cause problems with side effects like drowsiness, somnolence, or unsteady feeling when waking up, despite melatonin’s low toxicity [30, 33, 36, 42]. The included studies also investigated additional effects of exogenous melatonin administration on other outcomes such as sleep and core body temperature. Exogenous melatonin had a positive effect on sleep parameters [5, 31, 35, 37, 40, 44]. <b>Some studies showed that with higher doses and prolongation of supra-physiological levels, melatonin loses its effectiveness on sleep parameters, and with lower doses it can regain its effectiveness [25, 31, 44, 47].</b> <b>In addition to this, higher doses are more influential on body temperature [35].</b> But within these results, differences were found with a sustained-release melatonin dose of 0.5 mg, which either lowered core body temperature or mimicked the normal endogenous melatonin profile and did not intervene with normal circadian temperature rhythm [35, 37]." → Confirms most of these results of supraphysiological levels of melatonin were defined on older adults! But I have found other studies on younger subjects (20 years old) with also a carry over effect.</li>

<li>BEST: Long-Term Efficacy and Safety of Pediatric Prolonged-Release Melatonin for Insomnia in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder, 2018 <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132686/" title="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132686/" class="https">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132686/</a> - PedPRM, 2/5mg melatonin but up to 10mg/day! On children, for 52 weeks, and no serious side effect and beneficial effects sustained! Longest running RCT study about melatonin to my knowledge!</li>
<li>ME SUMMARY: Just for info if it can be useful: after parsing a lot of papers on the dosage of melatonin, there are 3 major things that pop out: 1- 0.3mg (or even 0.1mg) is enough to get some phase advance effect. 2- but 1-3mg work even better as they cause hypothermia (but also a hangover on the next day because any dosage &gt;= 1mg causes supraphysiologic levels of melatonin in the blood, which carries over to the next day - hence you may feel some drowsiness). 3- melatonin's role is mostly to consolidate the 2nd half of the sleep, so that you can sleep a whole night (or day depending on your circadian rhythm). It's a sleep stabilizer, not a zeitgeber. Hence, it's normal to have a deeper and longer sleep with it, that's (one of) the natural purposes of melatonin. Three major references: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013</a> , <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406</a> and <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" title="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full" class="https">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2019.00391/full</a></li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: melatonin without other zeitgebers can phase shift (advance) up to 3h over 3 days! Hence 1h/day of phase advance with melatonin alone. Also suggests strongly that when melatonin (and light) don't work for non24 or DSPD it's probably because of other conflicting mistimed zeitgebers (eg, sunlight)!</b> "More specifically, both PRCs indicate that <b>peak advances occur 3–3.5 h before the DLMO</b>. Both PRCs also show a broad range of delays. These similarities are quite remarkable, considering the two PRCs were generated with markedly different protocols (although with similar DLMO thresholds of approximately 3 pg/ml) and that the Lewy PRC was generated in the field, whereas our PRC was generated in the laboratory under more controlled conditions. By contrast, despite the Lewy PRC having an additional day of melatonin administration, <b>our PRC shows larger maximum phase shifts of about 2–3 h,</b> whereas the Lewy PRC showed maximum phase shifts of about 1.5 h. As we have previously described (4), <b>the smaller phase shifts in the Lewy PRC are likely due to the fixed sleep-wake schedule, the fixed light/dark cycle, and/or other 24-h zeitgebers opposing or constraining the phase shifts to melatonin. Our subjects were free-running and not constrained by 24-h zeitgebers.</b>" <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406</a></li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: CONFIRMATION of additive effect of melatonin and light therapy!!! + gradual shifting of intake/exposition timing improves results:</b> "We have tested protocols designed to shift human circadian rhythms using a gradually shifting sleep schedule plus bright light and/or melatonin at the appropriate circadian times (14, 18, 23–26). This approach can phase shift the clock without causing extreme circadian misalignment between the clock and the sleep/wake schedule, and thus avoids the associated jet-lag type symptoms and negative consequences of abrupt shifts of sleep. <b>By gradually changing the times of administration, the bright light and melatonin are more likely to hit the optimal times on their PRCs as they shift.</b> <b>We have observed that on average, the combination of afternoon melatonin and morning bright light are additive and produce the largest advances</b> (18)." <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" class="https">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406</a></li>
<li>Morning melatonin to speed up delays? Not yet tested: "Whether morning melatonin can enhance delays to evening bright light remains to be determined."</li>
<li><b>BEST: higher dosage (3.0 mg) is confirmed to be preferable for substantial phase shift such as for CRSWD!</b> "Our recommendations on what dose of melatonin to use to phase shift vary according to each individual’s circumstance. The 3.0 mg dose is more likely to produce a substantial phase shift than the lower 0.5 mg dose. However, if the potential soporific effect of the 3.0 mg dose (18) needs to be avoided, then the 0.5 mg dose would be more appropriate."</li>
<li>BEST PUBLIC REF: need 2-4h before DLMO, hence 4-6h before natural bedtime: "Timing is key. Don’t take melatonin right before bed because it takes several hours for it to become effective. If you are a night owl who normally stays up past midnight, but would like to nod off around 11 p.m., take melatonin at 6 p.m. Conversely, if you go to bed at 8 p.m. and rise at 4 a.m., it’s better to take melatonin in the late morning or early afternoon."

<li>"<b>Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of cardiovascular death.</b> It has long been accepted that <b>life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death) are more likely to occur in the morning after waking.</b> It is perhaps less well recognized that <b>there is a circadian rhythm in cardiac pacemaking and other electrophysiological properties of the heart.</b> In addition, there is a <b>circadian rhythm in other arrhythmias, for example, bradyarrhythmias and supraventricular arrhythmias</b>. Two mechanisms may underlie this finding: <b>(1) a central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus may directly affect the electrophysiology of the heart and arrhythmogenesis via various neurohumoral factors, particularly the autonomic nervous system; or (2) a local circadian clock in the heart itself (albeit under the control of the central clock) may drive a circadian rhythm in the expression of ion channels in the heart, which in turn varies arrhythmic substrate.</b> This review summarizes the current understanding of the circadian rhythm in cardiac electrophysiology, arrhythmogenesis, and the underlying molecular mechanisms."</li>

<li>"A number of circadian clock proteins as well as their accessory proteins (such as nuclear receptors) are highly sensitive to nutrient metabolism. Macronutrients and micronutrients can function as zeitgebers for the clock in a <b>tissue-specific</b> way and can thus impair synchrony between clocks across the body, or potentially restore synchrony in the case of circadian misalignment. Circadian nuclear receptors are particularly sensitive to nutrient metabolism and can alter tissue-specific rhythms in response to changes in the diet. Finally, SNPs in human clock genes appear to be correlated with diet-specific responses and along with chronotype eventually may provide valuable information from a clinical perspective on how to use diet and nutrition to treat metabolic disorders."</li>
<li>"Targeted use of specific nutrients based on chronotype has the potential for immense clinical utility in the future. Macronutrients and micronutrients have the ability to function as zeitgebers for the clock by activating or modulating specific clock proteins or accessory proteins (such as nuclear receptors). Circadian clock control by nutrients can be tissue-specific. With a better understanding of the mechanisms that support nutrient-induced circadian control in specific tissues, <b>human chronotype and SNP information</b> might eventually be used to <b>tailor nutritional regimens for metabolic disease treatment and thus be an important part of personalized medicine's future</b>."</li>

<li>BEST: guts/intestines is the biggest producer of melatonin, hence it's obvious that any effective CRSWD therapy should account for food intake composition and timing: "<b>Additional variation may result from the gut, which is both a source and sink of melatonin</b>,53–56 allows enterohepatic cycling of this compound,55–58 <b>contains by two orders of magnitude more melatonin than the pineal gland</b>,54 <b>and can release melatonin in terms of a postprandial response</b>.54,55,59 <b>Gastrointestinal release of melatonin in response to tryptophan was associated with profound sleep promoting effects.</b>53" → Postprandial sleepiness due to melatonin release!!! WTF!!!!</li>
<li>"<b>Since acute phase shifting and facilitation of sleep onset are also achieved by immediate-release melatonin</b>, advantages of prolonged-release melatonin or longer-acting synthetic analogs should rather be sought in the treatment of primary chronic insomnia."</li>
<li>"For reasons mentioned, the use of agomelatine should be only considered in conjunction with depression."</li>
<li>BEST: tolerance and addiction of melatonin: "In full agreement with numerous findings on immediate-release melatonin, all studies on the prolonged-release formulation <b>unanimously show that the recommended dose does not cause next-day hangover</b>, but rather favors morning alertness – although some exceptions have been described in other investigations using different doses. <b>It does not lead to dependence, early or late withdrawal effects after discontinuation.</b>51,77–79 <b>The development of tolerance is usually absent with melatonin</b>, although a few exceptions have been reported, especially in some children with neurological disorders.91–94 Should the development of tolerance turn out to be a consequence of altered metabolism, which remains to be demonstrated, other melatoninergic agonists might be tested. A recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study on prolonged-release melatonin confirmed the absence of next-day impairments of psychomotor functions, driving skills and memory recall, in contrast to 10 mg zolpidem.109 Controlled-release melatonin (2 mg) was successfully used even for facilitating benzodiazepine discontinuation.110 Like melatonin, ramelteon did not cause next-day hangover (as revealed by subjective feeling, psychomotor and cognitive tests, and ability to concentrate),105 rebound insomnia or other withdrawal effects, or development of tolerance or addiction.20–22,105 Under these conditions, both prolonged-release melatonin and ramelteon appear safe in short-term treatment, as may be assumed for other exclusively melatoninergic drugs in general."</li>

<li>Melatonin counter-indication: "Precautions are necessary in subjects with immunological disorders, since melatonin is also a mainly stimulatory immunomodulator.19,45,49 Thus, melatoninergic drugs should generally not be prescribed to patients with autoimmune diseases.51 "</li>

<li>BEST: " In humans, the <b>transient postprandial elevation of blood concentrations of melatonin may be the cause of sleepiness often experienced after the midday meal</b> (47).

<b>A reduction in caloric intake increased the lifespan of mice. The same effect was achieved when mice were fed melatonin</b> (122). As melatonin concentrations in various segments of the gastrointestinal tract increased in fasting animals (39, 74) it can be speculated that the increase of longevity in animals fed a low-calorie diet is due to their high production of melatonin in the gastrointestinal tract (39, 74). What could be the mechanism that increases the lifespan of mice with high melatonin levels? As stated previously, melatonin protects organisms against hydroxyl radicals (7). It has been speculated that lower blood levels of melatonin found in old people (123, 124) may be accountable for some symptoms of aging. It can therefore be hypothesized that an elevation of melatonin to youthful levels, induced by a hypocaloric diet, increases the antioxidant capacity of the organism and thus slows down the aging process." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a> sourced from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093</a>

<li>Melatonin, food intake and digestion: "Implants of melatonin in mice increased their food consumption (53). An increase of melatonin concentrations in peripheral blood of animals refed after fasting was reported in several studies (39, 74, 114). In addition, elevated melatonin levels were detected in human saliva after supper (115). The sudden pulse of melatonin released from the gut may be the cause of a shift in biological rhythms ( (such as locomotion, temperature, and cortisol rhythm in blood) observed after food intake (116, 117). <b>This shift in rhythms is not mediated by the pineal gland, as the destruction of the suprachiasmatic nucleus</b> (the brain area regulating the rhythmic secretion of melatonin in the pineal) <b>had no effect on such a shift</b> (118)." → melatonin is not a zeitgeber??? False lead??? Or rather the pineal gland is NOT managing the shift in circadian rhythm due to melatonin, maybe melatonin influences the cells directly since mitochondria process it. But still not a zeitgeber, it's a biological rhythm marker. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12395907/</a> sourced from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1859093</a></li>
<li>"When given during the day, a high dose of melatonin would cause mild narcotic effects, drowsiness etc. and the practice is not recommended for this reason. It would not shift the circadian oscillator much, because of the silent zone of the phase response curve for melatonin, in which phase shifts are negligibly small. This is the same reason that a <b>postprandial release of gastrointestinal melatonin does not shift the circadian oscillator.</b> [...] As mentioned above, pertubations of the internal time structure can also cause oxidative stress [77]." <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262766/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262766/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262766/</a></li>

In the laboratory, for example, the discovery of one protein was thrown into doubt when two opposing chronotypes performed the same experiment. When the ‘owl’ postdoc did the experiments in the evening, the protein was there, but when the ‘lark’ PhD student performed the same experiments in the morning, the protein was nowhere to be found.

We analyzed the effect of 1,280 pharmacologically active compounds with diverse structures on the circadian period length that is indicative of the core clock mechanism. Our screening paradigm identified many compounds previously known to change the circadian period or phase, demonstrating the validity of the assay system. Furthermore, <b>we found that small molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) consistently caused a strong short period phenotype in contrast to the well-known period lengthening by lithium</b>, another presumed GSK-3 inhibitor. <b>siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK-3β also caused a short period, confirming the phenotype obtained with the small molecule inhibitors</b>.

<li>"Circadian rhythms are coordinated by the SCN or “master clock”, however <b>the molecular mechanism of the clock is present in every cell of the body</b>. Circadian or clock genes (in humans- e.g. CLOCK, CRY, PER, BMAL) comprise an autoregulatory transcriptional-translational feedback loop which demonstrates a cycle every 24 hours (Hardin, Hall, &amp; Rosbash, 1990; Loros &amp; Dunlap, 1991). <b>In addition to individual cells, rhythms are also generated among organs including the heart, stomach, liver and pancreas</b> (Dibner, Schibler, &amp; Albrecht, 2010). Circadian patterns are also present among physiological systems, including the cardiovascular and renal systems (Dibner et al., 2010; Gachon, Nagoshi, Brown, Ripperger, &amp; Schibler, 2004). <b>These peripheral rhythms have a unique phase relationship with the master clock which is coordinated through neuronal pathways, neuropeptides and hormones.

<li>"By the Oxford Dictionary, misalignment refers to “the incorrect arrangement or position of something in relation to something else”. One of the most common types of misalignment studied is misalignment of the sleep-wake cycle in relation to the biological night. <b>Other types of misalignment include misalignment of feeding rhythms to the sleep-wake or light-dark cycle, or internal misalignment of central and peripheral rhythms.</b>" → <b>entraining the SCN with light and melatonin is not sufficient! Need also food timing to entrain the peripheral clocks!</b></li>
<li>"Individuals with evening chronotype (preference for later timing of sleep and activity) have been shown in some studies to have a shorter phase angle between circadian markers and sleep, indicating that <b>they sleep and wake earlier in their circadian phase</b> (Duffy, Rimmer, &amp; Czeisler, 2001; Mongrain, Carrier, &amp; Dumont, 2006). " → DSPD to adapt to social needs tends to sleep earlier than their circadian rhythm, compared to early sleepers. So they put more efforts in fact!</li>
<li>"One of the most significant and immediate consequences of misalignment of the sleep-wake cycle to the biological night is sleep disturbance and/or daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, difficulty waking in the morning and sleepiness caused by circadian misalignment are typical symptoms that lead patients to seek care in sleep clinics for circadian disorders. However, the physiological and psychological consequences are much broader than sleep-wake disturbance. These include changes in feeding patterns, metabolic function and risk for mood disorders. Other types of disruption include internal misalignment of rhythms, such as timing of central vs. peripheral clocks. For example, <b>research in animal models has demonstrated that altering availability of food timing shifts peripheral (e.g. hepatic) but not central rhythms</b> (Stokkan, Yamazaki, Tei, Sakaki, &amp; Menaker, 2001)."</li>
<li>"In a forced desynchrony protocol to <b>simulate the experience of living on mars</b>, individuals were assigned to a 24 hour day or a <b>24.6 hour day</b> for 25 days. <b>Interestingly, some individuals were capable of entraining their circadian rhythms and others were not</b> (Gronfier, Wright, Kronauer, &amp; Czeisler, 2007; Wright, Hughes, Kronauer, Dijk, &amp; Czeisler, 2001). <b>Results indicated that those who were non-entrained had poorer sleep quality, shorter sleep duration, and had lower leptin during wakefulness. Results from a later study also demonstrated decreased leptin and higher glucose response to meals despite higher insulin production associated with this misalignment</b> (Scheer, Hilton, Mantzoros, &amp; Shea, 2009). Most recently, a study compared 3 days of phase advance to three days of phase delay (21 hour day versus a 27 hour day), with a 4 week wash out period in between the two conditions (Gonnissen, Hursel, Rutters, Martens, &amp; Westerterp-Plantenga, 2012). Results demonstrated that in the <b>phase delay condition, total sleep time was related to levels of insulin and insulin resistance.</b> In a later analysis, it was determined that specifically, <b>decreased REM in the second half of the night was predictive of changes in cortisol, insulin and insulin resistance</b> (Gonnissen et al., 2013). Since REM is modulated by the circadian clock, this suggests a role of circadian misalignment in the metabolic changes reported in this study." → Circadian Syndrome</li>
<li>"The circadian rhythm of mood has been demonstrated in multiple studies (Wirz-Justice, 2008). These daily variations in mood have been studied in forced desynchrony and have been demonstrated to have a significant circadian pattern as well as an interaction with prior wakefulness, in that the trough of mood was lowest around the time of the core body temperature minimum and also deteriorated over the wake period (Boivin et al., 1997)."</li>

In a recent study, breast cancer survivors had a shorter disease free interval in metastatic breast cancer if bedtimes were “misaligned”(Hahm et al., 2014) as well as in individuals with later chronotype. Both chronotype and misalignment were independent predictors of disease free interval. This study defined misalignment as a self-reported bedtime earlier or later than the preferred bedtime. Further research is needed to determine the role of chronotype in cancer incidence, disease progression and treatment outcomes."</li>

<li>"Despite most of the population having intermediate to late chronotypes, work and school hours are still in favour of larks, beginning early in the morning and leaving evenings free. As we try to conform to this schedule, the majority of us experience some degree of social jet lag. This is most extreme in the later chronotypes, who are forced to get up well before they would do on a free day. This has consequences beyond sleep: later chronotypes, with greater social jet lag, are associated with greater mental exhaustion and depressed mood, and are more likely to consume caffeine, cigarettes and alcohol." <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" title="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" class="https">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979</a></li>

Although early birds are typically viewed as more productive, likely because their natural rhythm fits more closely with a 9-5 job, having a range of chronotypes in the workplace can be beneficial. In the laboratory, for example, the discovery of one protein was thrown into doubt when two opposing chronotypes performed the same experiment. When the ‘owl’ postdoc did the experiments in the evening, the protein was there, but when the ‘lark’ PhD student performed the same experiments in the morning, the protein was nowhere to be found. The answer? It was rhythmic! By chance, the difference in the lab’s working patterns led to a key discovery.

Taking it further, can we even use chronotypes to our advantage? In our ever-more 24/7 society, shift work is a feature of multiple industries – from manufacturing and transportation to the emergency services. In 2015, a study of factory workers used a ‘chronotype-adjusted’ schedule to match shifts with chronotypes. This meant no more early shifts for the late types, and no more late shifts for the early types. The new schedule successfully increased the amount of sleep the workers had on workdays, and they also reported better sleep quality and increased wellbeing.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 60pt'>
Whilst it may not be practical to reschedule shift work entirely, workplaces could certainly trial similar measures to match working patterns to chronotypes. Even in an office environment, allowing for flexible schedules with ‘core hours’ in the middle of the day where both early and late types meet could improve productivity as everyone works to their own rhythm. After all: the early bird may catch the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese!"

<li>PREJUDICE: Some psychologists push the idea that detrimental health effects and depression of night owls/dspd are due to unhealthy lifestyle choices which also impacts their sleep, when it can totally be the opposite, sleep causing all these factors! Ultimate attribution bias: "Still, Kripke cautions that night owls are also more likely to have lifestyle habits that disturb sleep — poor eating habits, lack of regular exercise, and alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use — which could also put them at a greater risk for depression and other health problems. Knutson’s own work supports this idea. In 2018, she and her colleagues found night owls were more likely to die at an earlier age than morning larks." → and Kripke didn't prove anything with that... <a href="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419" title="https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419" class="https">https://www.brainfacts.org/thinking-sensing-and-behaving/sleep/2019/are-people-really-morning-larks-or-night-owls-101419</a></li>
<li>"The real danger, Knutson thinks, is that <b>the modern world caters to morning larks</b> — night owls have to fight their innate sleep timing in order to fit in. “Trying to be a night owl in a morning lark world can affect how you sleep, how you eat, and how you exercise — all things we know can affect mood and overall health.”</li>

Rather than fighting your chronotype, she recommends people try to live in sync with their body’s natural circadian rhythms.<br>
“<b>It’s hard to fight your circadian rhythms</b>,” she says, noting that doing so means fundamentally resynchronizing them. “You can do it with a rigid sleep schedule and avoiding light at the wrong times, but it takes very consistent, very disciplined behavior.”"

<li>Fast decrease in temperature following sleep deprivation! "Sleep deprivation alters thermoregulatory responses. We used control of skin temperature to produce mild thermal challenge, both cool (32 degrees C) and warm (38 degrees C), and recorded esophageal and rectal temperatures, sweat rate and forearm blood flow in six healthy young women at rest. We discovered that after one night of sleep deprivation (1) both mean esophageal and rectal temperatures were reduced, (2) the mean threshold for sweating was not altered, and (3) there was no direct indication that skin blood flow was set at different levels with skin temperature neutral or cool. Peripheral vasodilation was attenuated when skin temperature was held at 38 degrees C. Following this period of mild hyperthermia, esophageal and rectal temperatures decreased much more rapidly in sleep-deprived subjects when skin temperature was cooled and held constant at 32 degrees C. We conclude that sleep-deprived women lose heat rapidly in response to a mild cooling stimulus. Sleep-deprived humans may be more vulnerable to heat loss with reduced ability to warm even at temperatures thought to be associated with thermal comfort."</li>

<li>But I remember an academic comment criticizing this study.</li>
<li>"Although melatonin is usually considered safer than benzodiazepines, an increased fracture risk has recently been reported with this drug, and caution should be advised for elderly patients at risk for falls.14" <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699865/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699865/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6699865/</a>
<ul>
<li>Sleeping pills: "Melatonin is only one option in the armamentarium of sleep solutions for older adults. On the extremely harmful end of the spectrum are benzodiazepines, the so-called Z-drugs (nonbenzodiazepines), trazodone, quetiapine, and over-the-counter antihistamines, many of which are used off-label. Almost 17% of 85-year-olds take benzodiazepines, despite questionable clinical benefit.15 Benzodiazepines reduce sleep-onset latency by 4.2 min and modestly increase total sleep duration, but the latter effect tends to wear off after 4 weeks.16 Benzodiazepines are associated with significant adverse effects, such as cognitive decline, delirium, falls, fractures, and dependence.17,18 The Z-drugs, including zopiclone and zolpidem, are not safer alternatives to benzodiazepines because they are also associated with a significant risk of adverse events, such as delirium, falls, and fractures, with minimal improvement in sleep latency and duration.17 Among over-the-counter medications, antihistamines such as diphenhydramine were identified as the most frequently used nonprescription products for sleep in a subset of older adults19; however, these drugs should be avoided for this purpose because tolerance develops when they are used as hypnotics, and they carry strong anticholinergic properties.17"</li>
<li>"Given the paucity of hypnotics that are safe for use by elderly patients, should melatonin be considered a legitimate alternative? Certainly the effect of melatonin on sleep, as demonstrated in clinical studies, remains of questionable clinical significance. However, when balancing the risks of insomnia itself, including impaired daytime functioning, cognitive impairment, falls, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality, and the known risks associated with benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, some may consider melatonin to be a reasonable alternative when nonpharmacological therapies have failed.12 <b>In Europe, Clay and others20 reported that campaigns to reduce the use of benzodiazepines and derivatives were less successful when not associated with availability and sales uptake of melatonin.</b>"</li>
<li>"If a trial of melatonin is considered, experts recommend low doses (as low as 0.3 mg up to 2 mg) given 1 h before bedtime.1,13 <b>In fact, many of the large studies involving older patients with insomnia used a 2-mg dose.3 Also, maximum concentrations reached with exogenous melatonin are higher in older than in younger adults</b>, and higher doses increase the risk of prolonged supraphysiological blood levels and possible side effects on the following day.1"</li>
<li>"Erland and Saxena10 analyzed 31 commonly available melatonin supplements purchased from local grocery stores and pharmacies in Guelph, Ontario. The products consisted of 16 different brands in various formulations, such as liquid, tablet, and capsule. The authors found that the melatonin content ranged from −83% to +478% of the label claim. Furthermore, lot-to-lot variability within the same product varied by as much as 465%.10 Sublingual and tablet products had the least variability, and liquid formulations had the greatest variability. Furthermore, 8 (26%) of the 31 supplements tested were contaminated with the indoleamine serotonin.10"</li>

<li>"While Poldrack was mulling over this possibility, Stanford geneticist Michael Snyder published a 2012 paper describing an “integrative Personal Omics Profile” of a 54-year-old male volunteer—himself. Snyder’s genome was sequenced and analyzed, and over 14 months, the research team made more than 3 billion measurements of his blood, saliva, mucus, urine, and feces. During the study—conducted as a proof of principle and to learn what a baseline “healthy” state looks like—Snyder discovered that he was genetically at risk for type 2 diabetes. With that information and the accompanying data, he was able to investigate biological pathways that kicked in as he developed signs of disease, which could have implications beyond Snyder’s individual health. Seeing Snyder’s work made Poldrack think that his crazy brain study might “not just be a goofy boutique project; it could actually have some scientific impact.” He was right: His 18-month ordeal produced the most detailed map of functional brain connectivity in a single person to date." — My Connectome project</li>

For example, in comparing sleep deprivation to the waterboard, OMS found the former was ‘a medically less risky option’ and that sleep deprivation and stress positions can also be used to ‘prolong the period of moderate use of the waterboard, by reducing the intensity of its early use through the interposition of these other techniques.’ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08989621.2017.1306779" title="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08989621.2017.1306779" class="https">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08989621.2017.1306779</a></li>

<li>"We did not find that placebo interventions have important clinical effects in general.

<ul>
<li>"So if you want to go to sleep (and wake up) earlier, you want to take melatonin early in the day. How early? Van Geijlswijk et al sums up the research as saying <b>it is most effective “5 hours prior to both the traditionally determined [dim light melatonin onset] (circadian time 9)”</b>. If you don’t know your own melatonin cycle, your best bet is to take it 9 hours after you wake up (which is presumably <b>about seven hours before you go to sleep</b>)."</li>
<li><b>BEST: melatonin does not change wake-up time nor total sleep time:</b> "melatonin treatment advanced mean endogenous melatonin onset by 1.18 hours (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89–1.48 h) and clock hour of sleep onset by 0.67 hours (95% CI: 0.45–0.89 h). Melatonin decreased sleep-onset latency by 23.27 minutes (95% CI: 4.83 –41.72 min). <b>The wake-up time and total sleep time did not change significantly.</b>"</li>
<li>"And what about non-24-hour sleep disorders? I think the goal in treatment here is to advance your phase each day by taking melatonin at the same time, so that your sleep schedule is more dependent on your own supplemental melatonin than your (screwed up) natural melatonin. I see conflicting advice about how to do this, with some people saying to use melatonin as a hypnotic (ie just before you go to bed) and others saying to use it on a typical phase advance schedule (ie nine hours after waking and seven before sleeping, plausibly about 5 PM). I think this one might be complicated, and a qualified sleep doctor who understands your personal rhythm might be able to tell you which schedule is best for you. Eliezer says the latter regimen had very impressive effects for him (search “Last but not least” here). I’m interested in hearing from the MetaMed researcher who gave him that recommendation on how they knew he needed a phase advance schedule."</li>
<li>"Does melatonin used this way cause drowsiness (eg at 5 PM)? I think it might, but probably such a minimal amount compared to the non-sleep-conduciveness of the hour that it doesn’t register."</li>
<li>Melatonin and blue light/dark therapy advices! Plus: "<b>These don’t “cure” the condition permanently; you have to keep doing them every day, or your circadian rhythm will snap back to its natural pattern.</b>" → no circadian plasticity!</li>
<li>BEST: melatonin phase delay: "The <b>greatest advancement</b> can be observed <b>when melatonin is administered 5 hours prior to both the traditionally determined DLMO</b> (circadian time 9)20 and the threshold-determined DLMO.21 <b>Delays are registered when melatonin is administered between 6 to 15 hours after DLMO.</b>1,8,13,22,23"</li>

<li>"Non-24 was first identified in a sighted patient in 1970. 13 Since then, a total of 39 case studies were reported in the literature before the first detailed clinical review (N = 57) was published in 2005 by Hayakawa et al. 14"</li>
<li>Yet, non-24 is still assumed to be in blind subjects rather than also prevalent in sighted</li>
<li>"<b>Gender difference with more affected men (2.6:1); 72% men, 28% women</b>; gender ratio was 5.7:1 in case studies (N = 39) prior to the 2005 study."
<ul>
<li>Maybe women are underdiagnosed as somatic anxiety instead of CRSWD? Because the difference is too huge (and unrealistic when we look at the discord for example)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"The mean sleep length of the patients was 9.3 ± 1.3 hours; sleep length was 8.8 hours (7.6-10 hours) in prior case studies. Period of sleep-wake cycle was 24.9 ± 0.4 hours (range 24.4-26.5 hours)."</li>
<li>BEST ETIOLOGY of non24: "<b>26% had suffered from DPSD prior to the onset of Non-24</b>; this percentage was <b>13% in prior case studies</b>."</li>
<li>BEST ETIOLOGY of non24: "<b>98% had a history of severely disrupted social functioning, such as temporary absence from school, leaving school, temporary retirement from office work, or retirement.</b>" → BEST criterion to detect non24 with simple questionaire!!!! Can design my own non24 diagnosis questionnaire!</li>
<li>BEST comorbidity of non24 with depression: depression can be increased or caused by non24, and is improved when the circadian rhythm schedule moves back more in phase with day-night cycle: "- 28% had psychiatric problems: adjustment disorders (N = 6, 10.5%), major depression (N = 3, 5.3%), schizophrenia (N = 2, 3.5%), obsessive-compulsive disorder (N = 2, 3.5%), social phobia (N = 1, 1.8%), generalized anxiety disorder (N = 1, 1.8%), and mental retardation (N = 1, 1.8%).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
 - Social withdrawal accompanied the development of psychiatric disorders in 15 out of 16 (93.7%) of these patients.<br>
- Of the 41 patients who did <b>not have a history of psychiatric disorders prior to the onset of Non-24, 34% developed major depression;</b> mean onset of Non-24 in patients who developed depressio (23.6 +/- 2.4 years) was significantly higher than that of the group without depression (19.2 +/- 1.0 years).<br>
- <b>In 5 of the patients who developed depression after the onset of Non-24, complaints worsened when they slept during the day and slightly improved when they slept during the evening.</b>"
</div>
<ul style='padding-left: 30pt'>
<li>BEST: freerunning non24 had no serious issue or comorbidity: "Among these 57 patients, the <b>only individual with no consequential work problems was a designer with a flexible work schedule</b> (i.e., he went to work when he rose and worked for about 8 hours each day)."</li>
<li>"While a variation of the N408 allele of casein kinase I epsilon (involved in phosphorylating clock-genes products) has been associated with DPSD and Non-24, 20 more recent epidemiological studies have cast doubt on this association. 21 Moreover, a congenital abnormality suggests that Non-24 problems would be more likely to occur during childhood (although not necessarily), which is a pattern that has not been observed."</li>
<li>"Further, the stress of living with Non-24 may increase the risk of psychopathology, as has been demonstrated with respect to depression. 14 To the extent that psychopathology results in isolation, the lack of social zeitgebers could perpetuate Non-24, which in turn could exacerbate psychiatric symptoms."</li>
<li>Norvegian old sleep experts recommendations: "Beginning bright light exposure for 30-60 minutes, 1-2 hours after natural awakening, and then gradually advancing the timing of the exposure until entrainment occurs." → so they were losing the biggest effect of light exposure by delaying to 1-2h after natural awakening!!!</li>
<li>"One potential problem for these therapies is that small changes in head position can sometimes lead to substantial reductions in the light intensity that reaches the eyes."</li>
<li>"However, in studies of DPSD, two weeks of lower intensity (2,500 lux) exposure for two hours in the mornings—as well as avoiding light in the evenings—was successful in advancing the core BT rhythm, inducing earlier sleep times, and promoting greater morning alertness. 2" → <b>core body temperature phase advance in DSPD using light therapy lamps and dark therapy!</b> Ref: Reid, K. J. &amp;amp; Zee, P. C. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Handb. Clin. Neurol. 99, 963–977 (2011).</li>
<li>"Vitamin B12 has been speculated to enhance the light sensitivity of the circadian clock, and has been used to phase-advance circadian rhythms. 25 However, no significant changes in sleep or daytime mood or drowsiness were observed in a multicenter double- blind placebo-controlled study of 50 patients with DPSD using vitamin B12 (1 mg, three X day for four weeks). 26"</li>
<li>"Blue wavelengths of light are particularly effective at entraining circadian rhythms, with magnitudes of phase shifts being similar to those observed for “full-spectrum” light exposure with approximately <b>185-fold greater intensity</b>. 27" — blue light therapy is about 185 more effective at circadian shifting than other colors!

<li>"In addition to being regulated by the SCN, melatonin levels also affect the SCN by reducing firing rates, 33 thus creating a bidirectional relationship between fluctuating melatonin levels and circadian rhythms."</li>
<li>"Although some sources recommend administration in the late afternoon, 5,24 others recommend intake 1-2 hours before bedtime. 2,6,9 Entrainment usually occurs within 3-9 weeks, but several months may be required, with continuing regular low-doses being necessary for relapse prevention. 9 However, other sources have reported that entrainment can occur within a few days if intake can be timed to the optimal part of the PRC for inducing phase advances. 8" → ME: yes, that's what Czeisler et al wrote when they proposed to use a very low dose of melatonin at the same time regardless of the current circadian rhythm state of the patient, they said the idea was to take until at some point the circadian rhythm will shift back to place and coincide with the optimal melatonin intake! But this is flawed in practice for 2 reasons: 1- it assumes perfect patient compliance, which does not happen in reality because the patient can forget or have accidents and such, and hence will skip a day or two of treatments at some point, and should then readjust according to the shifted circadian rhythm, 2- the patient has to wait for the circadian rhythm to move all the way until it coincides, which takes a long time (particularly if the daily phase delay is small like eg 30min, then can wait up to 45 days to get in phase) and until then the patient must go through the hassle of religiously taking the melatonin without seeing any benefits and while experimenting the side effects such as more vivid dreams and nightmares and potentially drowsiness, or even dangerous increase of risk of glucose and insulin tolerance reduction due to elevated melatonin levels during awake time periods.</li>
<li>Progressive lowering of melatonin dosage, step-down method: "For these reasons, some have recommended a “step-down method”, where patients are started with a higher dose (3 mg to 10 mg) and then taper to a lower dose (0.5 mg) once entrainment has been established. 6,9"</li>
<li><b>BEST: why melatonin is better than melatonin agonists: because of other health benefits:</b> "Melatonin agonists (compounds capable of stimulating melatonin receptors) such as ramelteon 35,36 and tasimelteon 37,38 may be effective for inducing sleepiness and entrainment. Although more effective than placebo in clinical studies of insomnia, <b>it is unclear whether these agents are superior to melatonin for circadian rhythm disorders</b> or for insomnia more generally. Notably, <b>these agonists lack the powerful antioxidant effects of the naturally occurring hormone.</b> 39" Ref 39: Reiter, R. J. et al.

<li>"Exercising in the middle of the resting phase caused that significant 100-minute phase advancement. Exercising towards the end of the resting period resulted in a phase delay. Importantly, exercising in the middle of the active period was not linked to any significant changes."</li>
<li>Modulating BMAL1 gene expression</li>
<li>"Taken together, the researches demonstrated that <b>muscle contractions can directly simulate changes in these muscular clocks</b>, allowing extremely specific fine-tuning. <b>Crucially, it's the muscle movements themselves that are making these changes happen</b>, the study suggests."</li>
<li>"On a micro-level, <b>your peripheral tissue clocks can become misaligned with the central one</b>. In a 2015 mouse study, the <b>misalignment of peripheral and central clocks (caused by eating during the “rest” phase)</b> <b>produced a metabolic-like syndrome</b>. This is similar to what is seen in night shift workers who are forced to work against their circadian rhythms." <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/E6691.abstract?sid=5b12cd81-a9c9-4763-a72d-a012109f8337" title="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/E6691.abstract?sid=5b12cd81-a9c9-4763-a72d-a012109f8337" class="https">https://www.pnas.org/content/112/48/E6691.abstract?sid=5b12cd81-a9c9-4763-a72d-a012109f8337</a></li>
<li>“We may also be able to use exercise as a treatment for a 'body clock disorders' that can occur in many chronic diseases such as heart disease."</li>
<li>"Exercise at ZT5, 5 h after lights on, induced a phase advance (100.2 ± 25.8 min; p  = 0.0002), whereas exercise at ZT11, 1 h before lights off, induced a phase delay (62.1 ± 21.1 min; p  = 0.0003). Exercise at ZT17, middle of the dark phase, did not alter muscle clock phase."</li>
<li>No confound with light!</li>
<li>ME CRITICAL: this demonstrates again that we shouldn't think in terms of a single clock, but a lot of different clocks throughout the body that are interacting together.</li>
<li>ALSO: if doing sport in the early morning, which is closer to ZT1 (end of the resting phase) than the middle, then it can even potentially phase delay! So the common advice is a bad one all around!</li>

<li>On humans: <b>BEST: sport zeitgeber best performance time is in the evening (6pm), not the morning (8am)!</b> Better synchronized to circadian rhythm.

<li>"A study on 101 people conducted in 2019 found that when people exercised at 7 a.m., or some time between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m., advanced some participant's internal clock.

Meanwhile, exercising between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. delayed the internal clock, making people feel more alert later in the day." <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/realign-body-clock-with-exercise" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/realign-body-clock-with-exercise" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/realign-body-clock-with-exercise</a> and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/53416-exercise-effects-on-circadian-rhythms" title="https://www.inverse.com/article/53416-exercise-effects-on-circadian-rhythms" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/article/53416-exercise-effects-on-circadian-rhythms</a> and <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276943" title="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276943" class="https">https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/JP276943</a>
<ul>
<li>ME: Flawed because uses melatonin as a proxy of the circadian rhythm, but still it shows that early morning exercising can phase advance the release of melatonin, hence it can help with falling asleep earlier. But likely not more than supplementing with appropriately timed melatonin, and it certainly doesn't help with waking up earlier, for that light therapy is needed. Also melatonin early release can still be masked by inhibition due to light exposure in the evening, hence without dark therapy, exercising is potentially useless.</li>
<li>ME: Also flawed because did not account for light exposure! Because light was limited to &lt; 50 lux at eye level, but it can still impact the circadian rhythm, particularly if the subject is a DSPD! So history of chronotype/circadian disorder was not accounted for at all <b>(no chronotype screening questionnaire which would be the bare minimum!)</b> + unwanted light therapy (even if low, but now we know that 50 lux is more than enough to induce a circadian rhythm shift if timed properly!). So this study may very well simply be the result of exposition to constantly timed dim light, this can very well induce a circadian phase shift.</li>
<li>But they used a good protocol + <b>BEST comparison of desynchrony protocols</b>: "ultra-short sleep wake cycle unmasks circadian rhythms from these stimuli which can otherwise influence their measurement. [...] In comparison with other circadian rhythm measurement protocols (e.g. constant routine or forced desynchrony), we believe the ultra-short sleep wake cycle method is superior for determining PRCs to 3 days of consecutive exercise stimuli. "</li>
<li>"But interestingly, the authors write that the “advance” and “delay” effects caused by exercising at different times held across the wide array of people of different ages and sexes in the study — even if the <b>exact timing and duration of those shifts is highly individual</b>." — high inter-individual variability in the circadian phase shifting due to exercising</li>
<li>"For example, approximately 20% of the world's work-force are shift-workers who have a higher prevalence of cancer (Lie et al., 2011), depressive symptoms (Asaoka et al., 2013), cardiovascular disease (Boggild &amp; Knuton, 1999), disturbed sleep, and accidents (Folkard et al., 2005) compared with full-time day workers. Moreover, chronic frequent exposure to rapid transmeridian travel has been associated with cognitive deficits (Cho et al., 2000) and mood disturbance (Ballard et al., 2006), and with reduced longevity in animal models (Davidson et al., 2006). Likewise, ಯsocial jet lagರ, associated with relatively extended sleep and delayed sleep timing on non-work days, has been linked to obesity (Roenneberg et al., 2012) and cardiometabolic risk (Wong et al., 2015). Accumulating evidence also points to associations of <b>circadian disruption with mood disorders (Lyall et al., 2018)</b>."</li>
<li>BEST TOSEE: association of <b>circadian disruption with mood disorders (Lyall et al., 2018)</b></li>
<li>"Watching video movies (less than 10 lux), working at computer games (less than 8 lux), reading, etc., were permitted ad libitum. "</li>
<li>BEST: natural freerunning period of some hormones or enzymes: "we estimated that the urinary aMT6s rhythm displayed an endogenous freerunning period of 24.32 h, i.e., on average aMT6s acrophase delayed ~ 19 min/day (Kripke et al., 2005, 2007)."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ME: Hence even if exercise may be a zeitgeber, its proper use for phase advance is not only cumbersome (working out in the middle of the biological night - but NOT towards the end else you get a phase delay, so the timing is very important!) and totally different from the usual advices (working out in the middle or early in the active period does not change the circadian rhythm!).</li>

<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: premature death due to sleep deprivation may be avoidable by complementing with anti-oxydants (study on flies and mice), and premature death seems to stem from guts, not the brain</b>: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049" class="http">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049</a>
<ul>
<li>"By depriving animals of sleep and comprehensively analyzing the bodily effects, the team uncovered a causal link between SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND PREMATURE DEATH. After days of complete lack of sleep, molecules known as reactive oxidative species (ROS) accumulated in the animals' gut, preceding death. However, when given antioxidant compounds that neutralized and cleared ROS from the gut, sleep-deprived flies remained active and had normal lifespans."</li>
<li>"We were surprised to find it was the gut that plays a key role in causing death," senior study author Dragana Rogulja, a neurobiology researcher at Harvard Medical School, tells Inverse. Many scientists assume sleep deprivations' lethality stems from impaired brain function.</li>
<li>"The closest evidence to say that sleep is really essential for life is the fact that not only that you see it all over the animal kingdom, but experimentally when animals are sleep deprived, they die," Rogulja says. "As far as we can tell, there's nobody that can live without sleep."</li>
<li>"To find out why, the team experimented with fruit flies, which share many sleep-regulating genes with humans."</li>
<li>Using temperature and genetic mutation to keep the brain stimulated, which in turns prevents from sleeping: "To keep them from dozing off, they genetically manipulated the fruit flies to express a heat-sensitive protein in specific neurons, known to suppress sleep. When flies were housed at 84 degrees Fahrenheit, the protein-induced neurons remained constantly active. In turn, the flies stayed totally awake for days on end."</li>
<li>"Researchers analyzed the tissue of different parts of the fruit flies and discovered that <b>no parts of the body showed remarkable change or unusual damage, OTHER THAN THE GUT</b>."</li>
<li>"The guts of sleep-deprived flies had a dramatic buildup of ROS, the highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules. In large amounts, ROS can damage DNA and other components within cells, leading to cell death."</li>
<li>"The accumulation of ROS peaked around day 10 of sleep deprivation, and when deprivation was stopped, ROS levels decreased. <b>Death was always preceded by the accumulation of ROS in the gut.</b>" — for context: "After 10 days of sleep deprivation, mortality spiked among the fruit flies. All died by day 20. Flies in a control condition who slept normally lived 40 days."</li>
<li>BEST: possible to rescue with food supplements thate are ROS antioxydants! "Then, the team tested <b>dozens of compounds with antioxidant properties known to neutralize ROS</b> to see if they might be able to prevent ROS build up. <b>They identified 11</b> that, when <b>given as a food supplement</b>, <b>allowed sleep-deprived flies to have a normal or near-normal lifespan</b>. These antioxidants <b>didn't extend the animals' lives that got adequate sleep</b> but seemed to <b>buffer the health consequences for sleepless flies</b>."</li>
<li>"<b>Giving antioxidants through food — if it clears ROS — it rescues lifespan</b>," Rojuljia says. "We were shocked when we saw this. It honestly like seemed pretty crazy and that's why we took several years to make sure that this is right."</li>
<li>"The team also replicated the experiment in mice and found the same "striking" accumulation of ROS in their guts."</li>
<li>"One in three Americans doesn't get the recommended seven hours of sleep nightly." <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html" title="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html" class="https">https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data_statistics.html</a></li>
<li>"Most sleep aide products aim to help people doze off, but none, Rogulja says, help buffer the effects of little sleep."</li>
<li>Causal relationship with ROS and sleep deprivation: when the animals are allowed to sleep again, ROS concentration decreases! + the fact that anti-oxydants eliminating ROS rescues life expectancy in otherwise non-sleeping flies also shows a causal relationship between ROS and premature death from sleep deprivation. From video abstract: <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30555-9.pdf" title="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30555-9.pdf" class="https">https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30555-9.pdf</a></li>
<li>No accumulation of ROS detected in the brain! + overexpressing antioxydant genes in neurons does not prevent death, it's really in the guts, not the brain!</li>
<li><b>"Our study identified intestinal ROS as the major cause of death in sleep deprived animals."</b></li>
<li>"The rescue can be achieved with oral antioxidant compounds or with gut-targeted transgenic expression of antioxidant enzymes."</li>
<li>"Because the brain does not appear to be significantly damaged by sleep deprivation (Cirelli, 2006; Cirelli et al., 1999; de Souza et al., 2012; Eiland et al., 2002; Hipo´ lide et al., 2002), some labs have searched for signs of oxidative stress elsewhere. In rodents, the endogenous antioxidant defense is <b>weakened in the liver</b> (Everson et al., 2005; Pandey and Kar, 2018), and visceral organs show evidence of oxidation after long-term sleep restriction (Everson et al., 2014; Pandey and Kar, 2018; Villafuerte et al., 2015)." → could NAFLD be caused by a perfect storm of mistimed aggressive carbs and low to no barrier due to chronic sleep deprivation in modern society? So the soda producers may not be totally wrong, it may not be only their fault! But antioxydants do not appear to help much with NAFLD recovery, but maybe it helps to avoid progression to NASH, and in prevention may prevent NAFLD acquisition?</li>
<li>Melatonin as an anti-oxydant, without modifying the circadian rhythm: "<b>Rescue of survival was achieved without increasing sleep itself</b>; all animals remained sleep deprived when supplemented with antioxidants (if anything, average sleep was reduced further) (Figure 6D). <b>This was true even for melatonin</b>, primarily known for its effects on the mammalian circadian clock (Pfeffer et al., 2018). Melatonin does not seem to play a major role in controlling circadian rhythmicity or sleep in flies (Hardeland and Poeggeler, 2003). <b>A lesser known fact is that Melatonin is a potent antioxidant (Tan et al., 2015), produced at high levels in the vertebrate gut (Bubenik, 2002).</b>" — even the authors note that it's not a commonly known fact that melatonin is a potent antioxidant!</li>
<li>See figure 5C: most of ROS concentration increase is in the <b>small intestine</b>, and the rest in the large intestine. The rest of the body see no difference.</li>

<li>ME SUMMARY: Breakthrough discovery: Scientists found that some food supplements containing anti-oxydants targeting ROS eliminates the risk of premature death in a study on flies and mice, and also found that premature death by sleep deprivation is always preceded by ROS accumulation in the guts, making the guts the central organ at play in premature death by sleep deprivation, and not the brain as scientists previously assumed: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study" title="https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/why-we-need-sleep-to-live-study</a></li>

<li>"This argues for a context-dependent value of antioxidants."</li>
<li>BEST CRITICAL: melatonin supplementation reduces gut dysbiosis (ie, rebalances gut's microbiota), so can help with digestive issues too as a side effect: "A recent study showed that circulating melatonin levels decrease with sleep deprivation in mice (Gao et al., 2019). In agreement with our findings, the authors found that <b>melatonin supplementation attenuates mucosal injury and dysbiosis in the gut (Gao et al., 2019)</b>. Based on our data, this effect of melatonin could be attributed to its antioxidant properties."</li>

<li>BEST: hypothetic explanation of why overfeeding (we eat more) when sleep deprivated: "Oxidative damage might interfere with the absorptive function of the gut, and the increased feeding seen during sleep loss (Baud et al., 2013; Everson et al., 1989; Koban et al., 2008; Mavanji et al., 2013; Newman et al., 2009; Rechtschaffen and Bergmann, 1995) could be an attempt to compensate for nutrient deficiency. In agreement with this idea, a high-calorie diet can delay death of sleep-deprived rats (Everson and Wehr, 1993)."</li>
<li>"Accumulated intestinal ROS might have systemic effects, for example by altering the gut microbial profile through direct bactericidal action or through modulation of gut immunity (Campbell and Colgan, 2019; Ha et al., 2005; Yardeni et al., 2019). Since microbiota regulate health and lifespan (Clark et al., 2015; Clark and Walker, 2018; Heintz and Mair, 2014; Smith et al., 2017; Thaiss et al., 2016), this might be a factor in early mortality. Intestinal ROS could also trigger a systemic inflammatory response independently of microbiota (Wu et al., 2012). Because ROS are important signaling molecules at physiological levels (Holmstro¨ m and Finkel, 2014; Jones, 2006; Li et al., 2018; Lim et al., 2014; Mittler, 2017; Oswald et al., 2018; Owusu-Ansah and Banerjee, 2009; Schieber and Chandel, 2014), lethality could also result from disruption of the normal ROS-dependent processes."</li>
<li><b>BEST: ROS accumulation may be the reason why digestive issues often happen along sleep disorders and chronic sleep deprivation + risk of colon cancer with circadian misalignment:</b> "Severe conditions were presented here, but <b>mild deprivation also leads to ROS accumulation in the gut, albeit slower</b> (data not shown). This means that <b>our results are likely relevant for chronic insufficient sleep in humans</b>, especially considering that, among the many pathologies associated with sleep restriction (Chattu et al., 2018), <b>gastrointestinal diseases feature prominently</b> (Ali et al., 2013; Khanijow et al., 2015; Parekh et al., 2018) and that <b>several gastrointestinal disorders are characterized by abnormal ROS levels</b> (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014; Campbell and Colgan, 2019; Pe´rez et al., 2017b). The risk of <b>colon cancer</b> is elevated by insufficient or <b>untimely sleep</b> (Schernhammer et al., 2003; Thompson et al., 2011); intestinal ROS might be tumorigenic through several mechanisms (Bhattacharyya et al., 2014), such as damaging DNA (Evans et al., 2004; Markowitz and Bertagnolli, 2009) or causing inflammation (Aviello and Knaus, 2017; Lasry et al., 2016). Inflammation is frequently observed with insufficient sleep (Irwin, 2019; Mullington et al., 2010) and is increasingly recognized as a driver of disease (Chung et al., 2009; Elinav et al., 2013; Gao and Hong, 2008; Libby, 2007; Rea et al., 2018)." → "untimely sleep" = circadian misalignment</li>
<li>ME: may also be the reason why melatonin is anti-aging? As when the pineal gland was removed, the animals lived a lot less, maybe it's not like melatonin extends life but it just helps in avoiding to reduce it because of oxidative stress. Hence it doesn't help in living 150 years, but it helps in avoiding to die decades of years before your natural life expectancy without oxidative stress.</li>

<li>"According to discoveries made in the 1990s by a Virginia Tech historian, Robert Ekirch, before the 20th century, our ancestors used to dabble in a kind of sleep called "biphasic sleep." This meant that instead of sleeping for one long, eight-hour period, they instead slept for two four-hour periods with a few hours of calm wakefulness in between. Charles Dickens, who had what academics now call a "quirky obsession with sleeping bodies," created a historic document of biphasic sleep when he described characters taking a "first" and "second" sleep in his 1840 novel, Barnaby Rudge."</li>
<li>""First of all, it was a good time to take certain types of medicine, thereby anticipating the science of <b>chronopharmacology</b> today, taking medicine for anything from sour stomachs to smallpox," he tells the magazine's podcast."</li>
<li>"While medical thinking would change radically between the 16th and 21st century, Joubert might have been on to something. A 1992 sleep experiment on this topic suggested that biphasic sleeping cycles may actually be our natural default."</li>
<li><b>BEST CRITICAL: probable cause of "weird insomnia": In short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic, Thomas A. Wehr, 1992</b> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" title="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" class="https">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x</a> and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-tech-saved-sleep" title="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-tech-saved-sleep" class="https">https://www.inverse.com/innovation/how-tech-saved-sleep</a>
<ul>
<li>"Results of a photoperiod experiment show that <b>human sleep can be unconsolidated and polyphasic, like the sleep of other animals</b>. When normal individuals were <b>transferred from a conventional 16-h photoperiod to an experimental 10-h photo-period</b>, their <b>sleep episodes expanded and usually divided into two symmetrical bouts, several hours in duration, with a 1–3 h waking interval between them</b>. The <b>durations of nocturnal melatonin secretion and of the nocturnal phase of rising sleepiness (measured in a constant routine protocol) also expanded, indicating that the timing of internal processes that control sleep and melatonin, such as circadian rhythms, had been modified by the change in photoperiod</b>. Previous work suggests that the experimental results could be simulated with dual-oscillators, entrained separately to dawn and dusk, or with a two-process model, having a lowered threshold for sleep-onset during the scotoperiod." → so to have a single long night, it's necessary to have a long light exposure. If the photoperiod/duration of light exposure during the awake time &lt;= 16h, it can lead to a biphasic sleep!</li>
<li>"This study compared the brain activity of participants who fell asleep with exposure to artificial light (as we often are today) and participants who fell asleep deprived of artificial light. The study found that <b>participants deprived of artificial light naturally shifted towards a more biphasic sleep cycle and that they had elevated levels of prolactin, the relaxation hormone, during their late-night wakeful hours</b>." — also if not enough light exposure, prolactin relaxing hormone is increased in late-night wakeful hours!</li>
<li>ME HYPOTHESIS: maybe overexposure or light hypersensitivity can also create biphasic sleep? It's maybe not a threshold, but an inversed U-shape bell curve, where 16h of light exposure allows for a full consolidated night in one go, whereas when getting away too far (too long exposure or too short) then sleep becomes more fragmented.</li>

<li>"The phrase, "It is not only what you eat and how much you eat, but also when you eat" sends a simple message about circadian timing and body weight regulation. Communicating this message to clinicians and patients, while also elucidating the neuroendocrine, molecular, and genetic mechanisms underlying this phrase is essential to embrace the growing knowledge of the circadian impact on metabolism as a part of healthy life style as well as to incorporate it into clinical practice for improvement of overall human health. In this review, we discuss findings from animal models, as well as <b>epidemiological and clinical studies in humans</b>, which collectively <b>promote the awareness of the role of circadian clock in metabolic functions and dysfunctions</b>."</li>

<li>Of course melatonin and galantamine</li>
<li><b>BEST: magnesium may be necessary for entrainment, and intake should maybe be timed:</b> Magnesium difference with melatonin and link with circadian rhythm:  <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-difference-between-melatonin-magnesium-in-terms-of-how-each-supplement-helps-you-sleep-15644629" title="https://www.bustle.com/p/the-difference-between-melatonin-magnesium-in-terms-of-how-each-supplement-helps-you-sleep-15644629" class="https">https://www.bustle.com/p/the-difference-between-melatonin-magnesium-in-terms-of-how-each-supplement-helps-you-sleep-15644629</a>
<ul>
<li>"While magnesium and melatonin are interrelated, they work in quite different ways to regulate the body's sleep-wake cycle. Every cell in your body has a 24-hour clock in it, and uses that clock to regulate things like appetite, metabolism and yes, sleep. <b>A study in 2016 found that magnesium has a key role in that 'body clock' in our cells, helping them all stay on track and act in concert to help us maintain a 24-hour cycle.</b> Having magnesium in your body doesn't just affect your brain; <b>it influences all your cells</b>." <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160413135707.htm" title="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160413135707.htm" class="https">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160413135707.htm</a> and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17407" title="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17407" class="http">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature17407</a></li>
<li>"Researchers at the University of Edinburgh and the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge used molecular analysis to find that <b>concentrations of magnesium rose and fell in a 24-hour cycle in all cell types, and that this impacts on the cells' internal clocks</b>. Further tests showed that magnesium levels were linked to the <b>cells' ability to burn energy</b>. It was already known that magnesium is essential to help living things convert food into fuel, but scientists were surprised to discover that it also controls when this biological function takes place, and how efficiently."</li>
<li>"Experiments in three major types of biological organisms -- <b>human cells</b>, algae, and fungi -- found in each case that levels of magnesium in cells rise and fall in a daily cycle. Scientists found that this oscillation was critical to sustain the 24-hour clock in cells. They were surprised to discover that it also had an enormous impact on metabolism in cells -- <b>how fast</b> cells can convert nutrients into energy -- throughout the course of a day."</li>

<li>Lack of direct sunlight without window can cause a deficiency of UV which can itself cause a lack of Vitamin D (since UV are necessary for our body to synthetize vitamin D) and then in turn lack of Vitamin D is linked to short sleep duration. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686746" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686746" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28686746</a> - but was in old adults, it may also be melatonin? Depends how they fixed that, is it by supplementing vitamin D or requiring the participants to be exposed to UV (and hence light, which regulates melatonin?)</li>
<li>In 2018, scientists at China’s Qingdao University analyzed the findings of several studies that looked at Vitamin D’s role in sleep. Their analysis identified significant connections between low levels of Vitamin D and a lack of sleep. They also found low levels of Vitamin D were connected to poor sleep quality. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213953/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213953/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6213953/</a></li>

<li>"The body produces its own Vitamin D, in response to exposure to sunlight. For this reason, Vitamin D isn’t actually considered a vitamin at all, but rather is classified as a hormone. Beyond sun exposure, people also receive Vitamin D through foods—fatty fish and fish oils, egg yolks, as well as fortified foods like dairy and juice."</li>

These thermoregulatory changes took place before sleep onset: sleep itself had minor further effects. Thus, when the confounding, long-lasting masking effects of lying down are controlled for, circadian thermoregulation initiates sleep, but does not appear to play a major role in its maintenance."</li>

«So when you buy blue light glasses that only block blue light or not even all blue light you can now see this is not optimal and you should avoid these if you are searching for the most optimal protection after dark, these are often characterised by yellow, amber or clear lenses, but as are results will show later, even red lenses may not be enough with some brands. The blue spectrum of light runs from 400-495nm and the green spectrum runs from 500-570nm.»<br>

«Yes. They are true blue blockers, according to Consumer Reports under the search of: Electronics&gt; Phones &amp; Mobile Devices&gt; Cell Phones &amp; Services&gt; 3 Blue Blockers Put To The Test. According to this report, Uvex Skyper is both the best and cheapest of blue blocking eyeglasses.<br>

This is how the Uvex S0360X performs:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24_files/41I6gqnTN0L._SL1600_.jpg" width="300"><br>
Review for the Uvex S0360X: «As a researcher in the field of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, I was ecstatic to find that people were using these glasses to improve sleep and adjust their circadian rhythm. For those who may not be aware, here's a brief explanation on why these would work: Our bodies are programmed to release melatonin during the night. With the advent of artificial light, we can expose our eyes to light during the night. When your eyes are exposed to light during night, melatonin release is shut down, disrupting your daily circadian rhythm (your brain thinks it's daytime when it is really night time), making it difficult to fall asleep. The receptors in your eyes that will convey the signal to halt melatonin release are most sensitive to light in the blue spectrum, providing an opportunity to prevent circadian disruption.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that putting on these glasses in the middle of the day will make you fall asleep. I won't go into the details, but these will only be effective for people who stay up well past sunset (9:00 PM or later) and expose themselves to bright light (TV, computer, most room light). They could also be used by shift workers or people suffering jetlag trying to shift their circadian rhythms, but that is not simple, as there are many factors that go into modifying circadian rhythms correctly, and one could just as easily make things worse.
</p>

<p>
I try to wear these about an hour before bedtime, because I'm usually looking a computer screen or TV. By blocking out light, and specifically blue light, wearing these glasses helps me fall asleep much quicker, and prevents blue light from disrupting my circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
The only downside is you will look like a mad scientist wearing them around the house. Also, anything blue colored will look gray and I can not differentiate between yellow and white text (major problem for anyone playing Diablo 3).<br>
As another reviewer also mentioned, if you wear glasses, these won't easily fit over your glasses. It barely works for me, and I have small frames.»<br>

<h3>Sleep deprivation</h3>

<p>

<li>“Studies show that over time, people who are getting six hours of sleep, instead of seven or eight, begin to feel that they’ve adapted to that sleep deprivation -- they’ve gotten used to it,” Gehrman says. “But if you look at how they actually do on tests of mental alertness and performance, they continue to go downhill. So there’s a point in sleep deprivation when we lose touch with how impaired we are.” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" class="https">https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T</a></li>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and brain damage</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll incur some minor brain damage.</li>
</ul>
It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells. Also, a study in the journal SLEEP found that just one all-nighter resulted in signs of brain tissue loss. Study researcher Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, said in a statement, “Our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neurodegenerative processes.”<br>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and weight gain/metabolic syndrome diseases</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Your insulin sensitivity will be a similar degree as if you had been on a high-fat diet for 6 months.</li>
</ul>
You read that right. According to a study out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, one night of bad sleep lowers our body’s sensitivity to insulin in a similar degree as 6 months on a high-fat diet. A decrease in sensitivity to insulin or “insulin resistance” makes your body unable to keep blood sugar stable, which can eventually lead to Type 2 diabetes. (Note: The study was conducted on dogs, but it’s still very telling.)<br>

Sleep and wakefulness regulation
Conceptually, 2 processes govern sleep and wakefulness:

The homeostatic drive to sleep (process S) is proportional to the duration of sleep restriction and becomes maximal at about 40 hours.
Circadian regulation (process C) creates a drive for wakefulness that variably opposes process S and depends upon intrinsic rhythms.14
Neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus exert master coordination of this sleep/wake rhythm, along with other behavioral and physiologic variables.15 Because the typical intrinsic period is slightly longer than 24 hours, synchronization to the 24-hour day (entrainment) is accomplished by environmental inputs (zeitgebers, or “time givers”), the most important of which is exposure to light.

«We postulated that patients with DSP insomnia had an inadequate capacity to achieve phase advance shifts of the circadian pacemaker which times the sleep-wake cycle. Chronotherapy was therefore designed to reset these patients' biological clocks by the phase delay route.»<br>
Also knew that hypnotics sleeping pills as a unitary treatment for all sleep disorders was a fallacy already in 1975s, and that they were bad for health: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
BUT makes sense that it should be easier, since human circadian clock is &gt; 24h, so delaying is easier than advancing and should ALWAYS be possible (but long term effect of being able to synchronize and MAINTAIN it is another story): This «is because delay shifts (in contrast to phase advances) are not solely dependent on the phase shifting capacity, but rather proceed in a direction common to the endogenous drift (Fig. 1) of the free-running human sleep-wake cycle. » <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
«This relatively rapid rate of phase delay was chosen to minimize the chance that the internal phase delay of the endogenous circadian system in response to the change of schedule would exceed the external phase delay shift being imposed. This would have only perpetuated the condition. Conversely, if the capacity of their circadian timing system to phase delay were exceeded on an i,mposed 27 hr day, the circadian rhythms in these patients would return to their presumably greater than 24 hr free-running period and therefore proceed in the same direction as their imposed rotation around the clock.»<br>

<li>bouger d'un seul coup à l'heure visee ne fait que causer sleep deprivation: «Note that when his scheduled sleep episodes were acutely advanced to the times he desired (from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on days 51 - 52), he spent almost all of both nights awake. His sleep efficiency was only 19.5% on night 51, rising to a mere 41.6% on night 52, notwithstanding the significant level of prior sleep deprivation at that point. This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities. Such sleeplessness even under the favorable laboratory conditions of quiet isolation and absolute darkness verifies his reported difficulty sleeping at those desired hours.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
<li>«It is of special interest to note that during this imposition of a 27 hr day, the patient's actual sleep became more and more interrupted toward the latter half of each bedrest episode. This is in marked contrast to the sleep records from the subject illustrated in Fig. 1 (days 21- 52), who continued to maintain consolidated sleep episodes while free-running on a 25.3 hr day.» → signe qu'on pousse trop, mais on peut forcer. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«These increasing periods of final awakening in case B indicate that the imposed day length of 27 hr (T = 27 hr) was beyond the upper limit of the ROE of his sleep-wake cycle (see Fig. 3). Fortunately, as we suggested earlier (in the Rationale), in such a circumstance the circadian rhythms of the patient should begin to free-run with a greater than 24 hr period. This indeed appears to have happened during stabilization (days 66-74), when the period of consolidated sleep extended a bit later into each scheduled sleep episode on successive nights, being nearly complete by the last three. These results highlight the importance of close adherence to the schedule during stabilization even if the patient encounters sleeplessness, since the rhythms are still in the process of reentrainment.» → confirme ce que j'ai testé. Donc pas ideal durant chronotherapy, sleep efficiency en prend un coup pendant 14j.<br>

<li>«However, recent evidence (J. Elliott, personal communication) indicates that PRC amplitude can actually be affected by prior conditions. It is therefore conceivable that recurrent phase shifts may contribute to the condition of DSPS.» → à force de phase shifter on devient dsps avec plus de facilités à phase delay que advance? et avec reduced env cues on devient non24?</li>
<li>BEST: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«Patients could be instructed to rigidly adhere to their desired, fixed bedtimes and wake times regardless of whether they slept during that period. They could then be assured that (like Mills' normal subjects discussed above), they would eventually adapt to the new schedule. However, it would be unlikely that most such patients would be able to adhere to the schedule during the prolonged period required (probably greater than 2 weeks) without very intense supervision. Even with such supervision, many would be unable to tolerate the discomfort resulting from sleep deprivation and internal dissociation (similar to the jet lag syndrome).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a> mirror: <a href="./SleepNon24_files/Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" title=".\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" class="file">.\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf</a><br>

BEST WARNING ME: this is based on one study of someone who delayed his sleep phase BECAUSE of external stress factors, thus he was compensating, not doing a controlled chronotherapy. And it's not the chronotherapy that led to non24, it's the fact that while being delayed, the sleep efficiency decreased, thus the subject was not resting properly, and as a consequence the internal clock delayed continuously until finding the correct time to have a good sleep! So the interpretation is totally the opposite, and non24 might be a mechanism in fact to find the correct sleep schedule that maximizes sleep efficiency! Thus if not good sleep efficiency, the circadian clock will shift until finding a sweet spot! Thus sleep hygiene might be VERY important to prevent phase shifting and ultimately non24! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881</a>

+ using hypnotics and stimulants not appropriate! + shifting can be a bit chaotic!<br>
«The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.21 The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure.22 Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.23 These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.»<br>

Since DeCoursey's study, Phase response curves might have some differences but it's a highly conservated behavior in all species: «<b>PRCs have been recognized as a universal feature of the mechanism of entrainment to all effective stimuli in a wide variety of species, from unicellular algae to primates.</b>»<br>
Humans have a ROE (range of entrainment, which differs between species and individuals) from 23h to 27h → more range to delay than to advance! To advance, can only do so in increment of max 1h, whereas to delay can do up to 3h! (like in my strategy 5)<br>

Intermittent fasting can affect circadian rhythms in a different way depending on the timing of food availability, suggesting that this regimen affects the SCN clock, similarly to calorie restriction. SCN resetting by intermittent fasting and calorie restriction might be the answer to many chronobiologic misalignments, accounting numerous proofs for the health benefits conferred by these regimens.<br>
Significantly, affecting circadian rhythms impairs the metabolism and cause metabolic disease aetiology, suddenly declining glycaemic control, increasing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. An acute circadian misalignment, for instance, may lift postprandial glucose concentrations by up to 20%, suggesting that preserving circadian coordination is crucial for metabolic welfare [65].<br>
Interestingly, research<br>
groups were able to demonstrate the perturbations of the biological clock during feeding and fasting and how they can intervene pharmacologically at this point. This model can be transposed into current practice by developing models that include the rhythm of diet and exercise to combat metabolic pathologies [17, 68, 85].<br>
Quintessential anabolic rhythms are noticeable in humans early in the morning or around noon, glucose tolerance is optimal, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and the thermic impact of food is more significant in the morning than in the night, leading to daytime being ideal for caloric intake and night time as ideal for resting and fasting, enhancing all secondary offensive mechanisms of glycaemic control and caloric balance, accordingly. On the other hand, the human circadian rhythm is not governed only by the day/night cycle. There is data in the literature and scientific studies demonstrating that a proper circadian rhythm modulates the function of organs. The most studied model is that of the liver due to its function important in maintaining energy homeostasis, being aware that it is under day-to-day diurnal storage and energy use.<br>
BEST: temperature peak-level in mid-day! And min during mid-night!<br>
"cyclic glucocorticoid production with peak levels early in the morning, are also determined by the SCN" -&gt; this may be why if you wake up not in your phase you will feel out of your mind!<br>
-&gt; Avoid high-fat diet!!! Can be partially reversed, but not totally: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733</a><br>
There is a clear relationship between human dietary behaviour and circadian clockwork. The regular feeding-fasting cycles represent dominant synchronizing signals for peripheral clocks by initiating a series of molecular entrainment pathways, able to conduct the circadian routine. In contrast, disrupted feeding schedules can fully uncouple peripheral oscillators from the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, reinforcing the statement that metabolic cues, modulated by diet, reach and signal the SCN and modify specific output pathways of the clock [11, 29].<br>

-&gt; BEST definition of entrainment: "The master clock within the brain is a functional high-fidelity receiver that reacts to ambient light–darkness signals, being the central element of the synchronization mechanisms. Nevertheless, <b>each cell of the body has a self-circadian oscillator</b>, regulated by a master clock that converges to conferring rhythm to every cell and organ compelling a complete functional system, through excitation of rate-limiting control measures of metabolic programs, in order to accomplish the circadian control of the entire organism. Essentially, metabolic control is not a regular circadian system output feature, but signal exerted by nutrients intake, energy turnover and the redox status represent precise feedback for cellular clocks. The circadian clock is intimately connected with the metabolic pattern, at all cellular organization and developmental levels, any insignificant misalignment in their communication channels efficiently deriving to a plethora of pathologies [44, 53]. Circadian clocks generate a high-fidelity inner projection of external temporal records by creating a cellular and whole organism dynamic environment that oscillates rhythmically at approximately 24 hours. Besides prompting daily rhythms, <b>circadian clocks are sensors for environmental data that enable them to stay synchronized with day-night alterations, light and dark, hot and cold, as well as all the resources that rely on these modifications, primarily food convenience</b>. <b>Molecular oscillators generate 24-hour rhythmicity at the cellular level</b> based on transcriptional-translation processes, metabolic feedback loops or their interaction. The temporal platform, which coordinates all functions to be performed at the right time within the 24-hour day, involves many interacting oscillators, all of which are part of the active synchronization process portrayed as entrainment [18, 52]. Any environmental factor that varies within the 24- hour day potentially can serve as an entraining signal, called zeitgeber. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a minuscule region of the brain in the hypothalamus, located directly above the optic chiasm, the dual function of circadian clocks as rhythm generators and sensors is particularly evident: it produces circadian rhythms in many of its cells, but also as a neuronal network it entrains these rhythms into the light-dark cycle through retinal feedback [23]. The SCN, often referred to as the primary pacemaker of the mammalian circadian system, serves predominantly as a relay station that transmits light and darkness data to additional oscillators present in the body by generating endogenous entrains, embodied at the molecular, physiological and behavioural level. As a central pacemaker, the SCN controls melatonin's pineal synthesis, but in the meantime, it reacts to melatonin itself, having regulatory potential on the core body temperature's daily rhythm."

"A diurnal rhythm of eating-fasting promotes health, but the eating pattern of humans is rarely assessed. Using a mobile app, we monitored ingestion events in healthy adults with no shift-work for several days. Most subjects ate frequently and erratically throughout wakeful hours, and overnight fasting duration paralleled time in bed. There was a bias toward eating late, with an estimated &lt;25% of calories being consumed before noon and &gt;35% after 6 p.m. "Metabolic jetlag" resulting from weekday/weekend variation in eating pattern akin to travel across time zones was prevalent. The daily intake duration (95% interval) exceeded 14.75 hr for half of the cohort. When overweight individuals with &gt;14 hr eating duration ate for only 10-11 hr daily for 16 weeks assisted by a data visualization (raster plot of dietary intake pattern, "feedogram") that we developed, they reduced body weight, reported being energetic, and improved sleep. Benefits persisted for a year."

<li>BEST: melatonin affects POMC gene, serotonin activates MC4 receptors, and both melatonin and serotonin are interdependent! "The administration of exogenous melatonin in rats has been reported to induce the expression of the POMC gene in the ARC. [...] The rhythm of the activity of serotonin neurons is also shown as circadian changes, with a clear downward trend during the dark phase and an increase during the light phase. The changes were revealed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), hypothalamus and striatum; and these changes are likely the result of interactions between melatonin and serotonin. Anatomic proof of the existence of direct dependence between these two hormones is demonstrated through the proximity of their receptors in the DRN. The inhibitive impact of exogenous melatonin on the immunoreactivity of serotonin neurons in the DRN was observed, and the receptor of melatonin type 1 (MT1) acted as an agent in this effect.

<li><b>BEST: Caffeine blocks the effect of adenosine, which is the molecule behind the homeostatic sleep pressure process S.</b> So of course taking caffeine can impact the sleep since this and the circadian rhythm process C are inter-related!

<ul>
<li>This is exactly what interests individuals with CRSWDs: the impact of caffeine when they are sleep deprived and with a circadian misalignment</li>
<li>They did a forced desynchrony protocol of a 28h day</li>
<li>"Increased alertness by caffeine is associated with a higher core body temperature (CBT). A lower CBT and a narrow distal-to-proximal skin temperature gradient (DPG) have been reported to be associated with improved sleep, yet whether caffeine influences the DPG is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the use caffeine during nighttime total sleep deprivation would reduce the DPG, increase CBT and alertness, and disturb subsequent daytime recovery sleep. We also expected that a greater widening of the DPG prior to sleep would be associated with a greater degree of sleep disturbance."</li>
<li>"Prior to sleep, caffeine significantly widened the DPG and increased CBT, alertness, and clear-headedness (p &lt; 0.05). Caffeine also disturbed daytime recovery sleep (p &lt; 0.05). Increased CBT and a wider DPG prior to sleep were associated with a longer latency to sleep, and a wider DPG was associated with disturbed recovery sleep (i.e., increased wakefulness after sleep onset, increased stage 1 sleep, decreased sleep efficiency, and decreased slow wave sleep) (p &lt; 0.05). A widening of the DPG following nighttime caffeine may represent a component of the integrated physiological response by which caffeine improves alertness and disturbs subsequent daytime recovery sleep. Furthermore, our findings highlight that sleep disturbances associated with caffeine consumed near the circadian trough of alertness are still present when daytime recovery sleep occurs 5 h or approximately 1 half-life later."</li>
<li>SUMMARY ME: caffeine increases body temperature, which makes it more difficult to fall asleep (increases likelihood of insomnia). Also it messes up with daytime recovery sleep at least up to 5h later (1 half-life later, so it can be 5 more hours until the complete effect of caffeine is removed - and that is without caffeine withdrawal symptoms!)</li>

<li>"Compared to placebo, sleep efficiency and total sleep time were significantly reduced."</li>
<li>"The data indicate that a saliva level of caffeine as low as 3 μmol/l directly affects sleep propensity or, alternatively, that the presence of caffeine in the central nervous system during the waking episode reduces the progressive increase of sleep propensity associated with wakefulness."</li>
<li>And it modifies the sleep stages in REM and NREM</li>

<li>Caffeine and withdrawal, to confirm: <a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx" title="https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx" class="https">https://www.everydayhealth.com/sleep/101/improve-sleep.aspx</a>
<ul>
<li>" "Like withdrawal from any addictive substance, sleep will be affected by the increased autonomic response — jitteriness, nausea, increased heart rate, headaches, and irritability,” says Dr. Brodner, adding, “all completely opposite from the relaxed serenity required for good quality sleep.” As the body adjusts to less caffeine, these symptoms should subside. "</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BEST ME SUMMARY: I previously thought caffeine could help to artificially increase our vigilance instead of harder drugs such as modafinil. I still do, but it can mess up sleep recovery in particular when sleep deprived. So it's a double edged sword for us, and caffeine should certainly not be taken or tested as casually as typical sleepers do, crswd people should be more careful with caffeine. When you are sleep deprived, caffeine can be expected to provide a temporary boost by inhibiting adenosine binding to the receptors and hence a reduction in the homeostatic sleep pressure process S, but you can also expect caffeine to worsen the effects of sleep deprivation down the road, as it will even disturb later sleep recovery such as napping. So if you're sleep deprived, taking caffeine is the last thing you want to do (despite being what we usually do...). Note also caffeine works on adenosine, the homeostatic process S molecule, so that's why it increases vigilance and messes up with sleep.
<ul>
<li>BEST ME: This is why your sleep is chaotic, and why you shouldn't use sleeping pills nor caffeine <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/greti7/this_is_why_your_sleep_is_chaotic_and_why_you/</a></li>

&gt; The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore <b>use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.</b><br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, <b>some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure</b>. Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, <b>a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.</b> These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.

In other words, when trying to constraint to a socially normal schedule, it's normal that sleep times become more chaotic, with sometimes longer and sometimes shorter sleep, which makes it hard to see a nice N24 cycling pattern. Hence the importance of getting an opportunity to free-run without appointments nor alarm clocks.

For stimulants such as caffeine, this info can be combined with the following two sources:<br>

Which shows that caffeine, although relieving some adenosine and hence some sleep pressure in the short term, worsen sleep deprivation down the line as it messes up with body temperature increasing the likelihood of insomnia and preventing later sleep recovery such as napping. In other words, for people with a CRSWDs and that are chronically sleep deprived, caffeine is the last thing you want to do to get better, it's only a temporary vigilance boost that you'll have to pay later with more sleep deprivation and more difficulty to recover from it.

"After eating -- particularly sugary foods -- insulin is produced by the pancreas which then converts these sugars (glucose), circulating in the bloodstream into glycogen within our cells," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"Excessive secretion of insulin causes the essential amino acid tryptophan to move into the brain. Once in the brain, it leads to increased production of serotonin and melatonin, which are two neurotransmitters that have a calming effect and help regulate sleep. Interestingly, around 90 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal movements."
</p>

<p>
Accredited practising dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon agrees, saying the amount of carbohydrates we eat at lunch can affect how sleepy we feel afterward.
</p>

<p>
"Carbohydrate containing foods such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes boost the production of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin, which can boost our mood but also make us feel content and possibly sleepy," O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia.
</p>

<p>
"It's often when we've eaten quite a large meal that we may feel uncomfortable and sluggish, as well, so it's always good to listen to our hunger signals and stop when we feel comfortably satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Another factor that may contribute to drowsiness after a meal is if you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance.
</p>

<p>
"Food allergies and intolerances are usually associated with digestive problems such as bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea, as well as lethargy," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"For example, you've probably heard or experienced that turkey can make you sleepier than other foods. Turkey and other high protein foods such as spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu and fish contain higher levels of tryptophan. Studies have shown that cherries (particularly sour cherry) affects melatonin levels, which is the hormone responsible for inducing sleep."
</p>

<p>
Another sleepiness inducing food is white bread, particularly when compared to whole grain, wholemeal or multigrain bread.
</p>

<p>
"When you consume white bread your body quickly absorbs the fibre-less starches and refined sugars rapidly, which causes a spike your blood glucose levels. This spike is short lived and results in plummeting blood glucose levels, which can lead to feelings of tiredness and sleepiness," Clark said.

</p>

<p>
An amino acid called tryptophan, which occurs in many protein-rich foods, helps the body produce serotonin. Carbohydrates help the body absorb tryptophan.<br>
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" title="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" class="https">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating</a>
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY: proteins increases levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which by itself makes us drowsy after lunch and additionally promotes secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Carbohydrates (glucides) help the body absorb tryptophan and thus secrete serotonin. So low-fat, high-carb, high-protein food increases serotonin naturally. Low-carb, low-protein, high-fat (ketogenic) diet on the other hand avoid serotonin secretion and thus can lead to improved energy levels (at the expense of mood?). -&gt; so if really difficult to stay on low-carb because of mood issues, try taking 5-HTP complement (but then probably reduced phase advance effects).
