<h3>Foreword</h3>

<br>

<p>
This is a draft of a potential article for a work-in-progress therapy to manage non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD). These procedures have not been vetted by the medical community nor reviewed by the scientific community. Thus, it is NOT recommended to follow the therapeutic procedure outlined in "A new combined therapy", "Stage 1", "Stage 2" and "Preliminary results" sections, as they should be considered totally unreliable. At the time of this writing, this therapy produced little effect to improve the condition. However, the "Introduction" and "Current therapeutic approaches" section can be safely read and provide a review of the state-of-the-art knowledge on this and similar circadian rhythm disorders. Please also note that this text (and the additional bibliographies below) may be partly written in french (the author's native language).
</p>

<p>
This draft was written by Stephen Karl Larroque in 2019.

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<br>

<p>
Sleep and circadian rhythm are highly conservated behaviors across all animals, and with some main components such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus, also called "master clock", regulating sleep by light (photic) inputs, and having precedence over all other peripheral clocks (Aschoff 198?), such as the pituitary gland which secretes melatonin, or insulin secreted by the liver and temperature modulation in the intestines. These structures are present in all vertebrates[???], which shows they are highly conservated in evolution and are thus serving critical homeostatic functions. Although both of these functions are still under active research to understand them comprehensively, we know that circadian rhythm's purpose is to allow for a living organism to be in synchrony with its environment: to be awake when it's possible to seek food, and to sleep otherwise to recover for the next day. As such, all living organisms rely on these two crucial functions to support their activities. Any disruption, or any abnormal sleep pattern, can therefore only be rare and significantly disruptive as this would cause the living organism to fit less with its environment, and thus decrease its survival chances if we follow darwinian principles.
</p>

<p>
For humans, we know very well how much sleep is healthy depending on age, with diminishing length with increased age [<a href="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" title="https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png" class="https">https://i.redd.it/ma3aj5nj81i31.png</a>]. If the sleep duration is quite well defined, the bed time and wake up time are more variable, with some people being "early birds", others "night owls", and others in-between. These chronotypes can be detected by using questionnaires such as the Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire[55].
</p>

<p>
Besides the social isolation and "laziness" stigmata that sleep and circadian rhythm disorders may produce — a persistent myth despite the fact that motivation, alertness and performance are directly influenced by sleep and circadian rhythms[56,58] —, they can lead to several health complications, nearly all stemming from acute or chronic sleep deprivation: from reduction of attention, memory and performance in work settings with only a single night of sleep deprivation, to brain grey matter atrophies and gene modifications[???], and increased risks of accidents[58, ??? hospital workers accidents]. These effects are observed not only during experimental sleep deprivation, but also in settings where there is time to sleep but a shifting work schedule, which represents 15% of all full-time workers in the United States in 2009[59], such as hospital night shift workers [???], firefighters[59], polar antartica expeditions[61], submariners[60] and the NASA Mars Pathfinder and Rover staff[57, 58]. Interestingly, in this latter case, the workers were tasked with following an unnatural 24.65h schedule, to follow martian day-night cycle. The authors report that in 2004, the veteran workers of the Pathfinder mission, described as highly motivated and dedicated to their work, decided in "a rebellion" to stop it <b>after only 1 month</b>, describing the schedule as "broken"[58]. Although the study authors could later setup a strategy to help the workers better synchronize their sleep-wake schedule on the Rover mission, they continued to report an increasing fatigue, hinting at a reduced sleep efficiency despite sleeping theoretically sufficient hours[58]. This goes to show the difficulty for any human being to follow a non natural sleep schedule, with chronic sleep deprivation effects becoming unbearable after only a month, even for highly trained and dedicated workers.
</p>

<p>
Non-24-sleep-wake-disorder (N24SWD) is a circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder (CRSWD) where the subject experiences a naturally and uncontrollable increasing shift in bed time [44]. It can be diagnosed using various methods with different degrees of precision: from simple sleep logs where the patient simply writes the bedtime and wake up time, to polysomnographs, minimal temperature monitoring and salivary tests for dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO).[44] It is also possible to use actimetry, as it was shown to be an accurate enough measurement method.[46]
</p>

<p>
(TODO: add prevalence, risks, genetics, etc on N24SWD or circadian rhythm disorders if not available)
</p>

<p>
Circadian rhythm disorders are complex, as they involve both internal clock mechanisms and external environmental cues ("zeitgebers", which influence on sleep was only relatively recently recognized since 1978[2]). In her landmark paper, De Coursey discovered the Phase Response Curve (PRC), a model of the complex interactions between the internal clock and external cues that was shown to be highly conservated across evolution, across all animal taxons[2]. This curve was first devised for the response to light, but is now also including melatonin, in what is now called a dark-light cycle[??]. This cycle can be succinctly summarized as follows: light stimulation close before sleeping delays the sleep onset (bedtime), whereas light after mid sleep advances sleep offset (wake up time). Melatonin does the opposite: administration close to bed time will advance sleep onset, whereas administration after mid sleep will delay sleep offset. Administration of light or melatonin at any other time during the wakeful phase has little to no effect on the PRC[19].
</p>

<p>
However, although the PRC shape and behavior is conservated in all animals, the exact timing will change between species: nocturnal animals will have their PRC's tau point (the central point of the PRC shape, from which the external cues effects are distributed around — this point is usually at about the mid-time of the sleep phase) during the day, since they sleep during the day, rather than at night. Furthermore, this can change between individuals: some will have their tau value early (the early birds), others later (night owls), and those afflicted with circadian rhythm might have it set during incomfortable times, or even an ever moving tau time for the non 24 free running disorder. The importance of the PRC for the sleep regulation cannot be overstated: it was found that the timing of light exposure relative to the PRC accounted for about 71% of the inter-individual variability of the PRC adaptation to night shift work, suggesting that although the PRC is only one of the sleep regulator mechanism — another one being the sleep homeostasis, regulating sleep pressure, as in Borbély's two-process model —, it is most likely the most important mechanism regulating the temporality/synchronicity with the zeitgebers of the circadian rhythm[25]. Furthermore, interactions between sleep homesteostasis and the PRC were experimentally observed, further supporting Borbély's model[11, 26, 41].
</p>

<p>
It is well known that humans, and nearly all animals, have a circadian phase length tau that is slightly beyond 24h, for humans it's about 24.2 according to NIH[1]. It was repeatedly demonstrated experimentally that isolating a human subject from any environmental cues (including light/dark cycle but also noise and thermal variations, food intake and exercise) causes a loss of entrainment to these external cues and ultimately a desynchronization from the 24h day cycle, causing the subject to revert back to its natural internal clock cycle beyond 24h[1, 2]. In other words, it can be said that humans are naturally non24. The problem lies when there is an impossibility to entrain properly (ie, to be synchronized to the target time) to these external cues, and thus to follow a 24h day cycle. In other words, although anybody can function on a bigger than 24h cycle in the absence of external cues, non 24h can only function in such a way, regardless of external cues. A corollary is that advancing cues (light around wake-up time) and pertinent elimination of delaying cues when necessary (absence of light/increase of melatonin before bedtime) are of paramount importance for any human to entrain to a 24h day cycle.
</p>

<p>
Another source of variability in the PRC shape resides in the magnitude of the response to external cues (ie, the height of the PRC). Not only the magnitude depends on the intensity/dosage of the zeitgeber[43], it also varies inter-individually because of endogenous factors[12]. Furthermore, the response to advancing or delaying cues is asymmetrical: on average, humans have been shown to have a range of entrainment (ROE) — which is the range of day time that one can maintain — to have been estimated between about 23h to 28h[2]. The magnitude is also asymmetrical, with low intensity light suppressing melatonin (and thus producing a delaying effect)[10, last ref], whereas high intensity light is required in the morning to advance the phase[43]. In other words, humans have a much easier possibility of delaying — and living on an extended day longer than 24h — than to advance by reducing their day duration. For instance, to make children sleep earlier than their usual time, it is advised to advance by small increments of 15 minutes[??]. Czeisler CA hypothesized that subjects with delayed sleep disorder (DSPD) may have an even weaker response to advancing the PRC phase, such that delaying was almost the only possible route. They furthermore tested their hypothesis experimentally on 5 DSPD subjects by devising a chronotherapy involving a tau of 27h for one week, in other words a daily 3h shift, which suggests that indeed DSPD subjects more easily responded to delaying than advancing, similarly to what was observed also in healthy volunteers without a circadian phase disorder (see below), although more studies with randomized trials with a bigger sample size are needed to confirm.
</p>

<p>
As written by [2]: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance). »
</p>

<p>
Both the inter-individual variability of the PRC[12] and the hyper-sensitivity of DSPS to delaying light cues[13] have now been observed experimentally, further supporting Czeisler et al's hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
Finally, a third source of variability is that the PRC shape is centered around the tau point, the mid sleep time, which is equal to the day cycle duration. Combined with the asymmetry in the PRC shape, this might make an absolute (but not relative) advancing an impossible feat for subjects with circadian phase disorders. For example, if a human is on average able to advance 30 min daily, depending on their own tau, a person might be unable to effetively advance: if the tau is 24.2 (24h and 12 minutes), then the advancing capacity exceeds the natural free running induced by the internal clock ; but if another person has a tau of 25h, with the same advancing capacity, then the maximal advancing capacity is only of 24h30, which exceeds a 24h day schedule, meaning that even with proper response to external cues, this individual cannot entrain to a 24h day, but only to a 24h30 day. Thus, the tau and magnitude of an individual's PRC are mathematically critical parameters for this individual to be able to entrain to a 24h day cycle. And indeed, non 24 free running disorder (N24) and DSPD were both recently shown to have a delayed tau (mean phase duration)[3, 4], confirming one of Czeisler CA et al's hypotheses[2]. Footnote: In the 2016 study, it was found that DSPD had a tau of about 24.5h, whereas N24 had more than 25h. This would suggest that N24 might have as a defining characteristic a longer tau than other circadian rhythm disorders. However, this study had a very low sample size, particularly for N24 which was only of 2 subjects. Furthermore, the 2013 study on DSPD patients only found an average tau of 25h, thus eliminating the apparent (but non statistically significative) difference found in the 2016 study.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, DSPD were shown to have a delayed melatonin profile[18].

Thus, it is ALWAYS possible for a human to delay as well as advance, but advancing is always more limited compared to delaying. The corollary is that humans can modify their sleep onset/offset, simply by letting their natural clock free run.
</p>

<h3>Current therapeutic approaches</h3>

<br>

<p>
Several treatments were proposed for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
The pituitary gland is an important component of the sleep-wake rhythm in humans. It was shown through lesional studies to regulate the circadian rhythm, and hence got the nickname of "master clock".[47] It is influenced by both light and melatonin.[47] In blind non 24 subjects, lesions in the pituitary gland have been regularly observed[??]. This led to the hypothesis that this disorder may be caused by dysfunctions in the master clock. Hence, the two most pursued treatments for non 24 so far have been by modulating these two antagonistic signaling pathways, melatonin, the "darkness hormone" which is secreted in the absence of light, and light, which inhibits melatonin secretion.
</p>

<p>
Melatonin has historically been the first line of treatment for non 24 in blind people. It was shown to be effective for entrainment in up to 67% of the subjects.[45] However, since this is a natural hormone that is not patentable, no pharmaceutical industrial went through the process of validating melatonin through national institutions such as the USA Food And Drugs Administration, and thus melatonin is not officially recognized as a treatment for non 24, although there is good evidence this is the case.[44, 45] There is currently only one recognized drug treatment for non 24, which is Tasimelteon (commercial name Hetlioz),[44] with an entrainment rate of 20% in a randomized controlled study, which seems considerably lower than melatonin's entrainment rate.[45] Apart from these two drugs, there is currently not enough evidence for any other kind of treatment or therapies for non 24, according to the 2015 guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM).[44, 45] As pointed out by an excellent review, the AASM made their criteria more difficult in the latest revision of their guidelines, so that only treatments with reliably high confidence of effectiveness could be recommended, but that does not mean other therapies are ineffective, simply that there is not sufficient evidence.[45]
</p>

<p>
Light therapy was proposed as a way to advance the PRC. Increase in cognitive performance and attention was noted for night shift workers using a bright light (which definition of bright varies depending on the study) during their shift at night. However, light therapy has shown limitations: light cues have no effect on the circadian rhythm if outside of the PRC curves[19] (ie, only effect is around bedtime and wakeup time, during the individual's wake up period there is no effect), and furthermore sleep pressure can also reduce or nullify the effect of light[21]. Thus, it is important to both time correctly the light therapy according to the individual's PRC curve, and to ensure the individual is properly rested so that the light cue can be effectively processed to advance/delay the PRC.
</p>

<p>
An extension of the light therapy is the corollary dark therapy, which is to ensure that delaying light cues are minimized. Such a dark therapy usually involves either placing the individual in a dark room in the laboratory setting, as is often done to measure the natural DLMO and minimal temperature in order to qualify the circadian rhythm parameters such as its duration tau. Outside of the laboratory setting, experiments attempted to use accessories to help shift workers better adapt to their schedule, with significant success. Blue blockers glasses were shown to be efficient in improving the sleep efficiency and circadian rhythm delaying for night shift workers, and are now formally recommended by health bodies.[20] Although historically most studies have studies either light therapy or dark therapy, their combinations seem nowadays only natural since their complex interactions, by compounding or nullifying, provide an excellent mean to adjust one's circadian rhythm as shown in night shift workers[41].
</p>

<p>
Some have argued that the difference in the circadian rhythm might reflect an adaptation to a different timezone, and thus that moving the individual to a proper timezone would correct the chronotype. However, this was not supported by experiments, where the light exposure and occupation were explaining all the differences in the individuals chronotypes with no to little effect of the timezone.[17]
</p>

<p>
Another approach is chronotherapy. A naive chronotherapy commonly devised by non24 involves building a high sleep pressure by prior sleep deprivation, allowing to sleep at the target bedtime even though it is not in phase with the endogenous circadian rhythm and thus would mostly prevent any attempt to sleep during this high wakefulness period, bar for the high sleep pressure. This strategy is also employed by night shift workers[38, 41]. Needless to say, such strategies have very deleterious effects, not only in the long term, but also in the short term[??].
</p>

<p>
There are however more elaborate chronotherapy schemes that do not involve or limit sleep deprivation. A study on 5 DSPS patients found that chronotherapy was very effective to resynchronize the circadian rhythm faster to the target time by allowing free-running and even furthering the free-running to a higher tau (eg, follow a 27h day schedule instead of the endogenous 24.5h)[2]. All these patients were able to maintain their desired sleep schedules for months or even years after the therapy[2]. Despite the promises shown by chronotherapy in DSPS patients, a few authors raised concerns about the risk of modifying the tau parameter under the effect of artificial extension during chronotherapy[7], which stopped investigations into chronotherapy for circadian rhythm disorders since then. For instance, a case study reported the case of a DSPD patient transitioning to N24 after self-initiated adaptations in his lifestyle to accustom with his DSPD disorder[??]. This led to some suboptimal adaptations, such as practicing sport in the evening/night, which is known to negatively affect sleep efficiency when done this close to sleep onset[??]. This led some authors to argue this resulted in a regularly applied extended delay, ultimately causing a transition from DSPD to N24. This interpretation is arguable, as the patient did not follow a formal and controlled chronotherapy, but rather attempted to adapt his own schedule to his DSPD condition. Thus, the causality might be inversed: instead of the extended delay causing a switch to N24, it could be that the delay was caused by the DSPD transitioning to a N24. Thus, it can be debated whether these adaptations were caused by the DSPD condition, and whether a more appropriate and controlled chronotherapy would have instead enhanced his condition instead.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, these criticisms raise a new concept that was seldom, if never, studied before: <b>the possibility to change the tau parameter (by reduction/advancing or by expansion/delaying) via a behavioral therapy, which we name the notion of tau adaptation (or compounding tau effect?)</b>. In other words: would forcing oneself to live longer days than the innate internal clock eventually lead to the internal clock adjusting to the new daylength?
</p>

<p>
Depending on the existence of the tau adaptation phenomenon, two very interesting scenarios are possible:<br>
<ul>
<li>Either the tau parameter cannot be changed, in which case chronotherapy is a safe way to move faster the sleep onset/offset and partially resynchronize with a desired schedule, thus increasing drastically the patient's quality of life by allowing some degree of control over the disorder. In practice, this would allow such an individual to reduce the timespan with a very incomfortable sleeping schedule by increasing the delaying step (eg, sleep 3 hours later than the day before, instead of the usual 1h for an individual with a 25h cycle, to "skip" dephased days faster) ; as well as increase the timespan in a desired sleeping schedule by advancing the PRC daily during this period (eg, sleep 30 minutes earlier everyday compared to the day before, such that an individual with an usual 25h cycle would live on a 24h30 cycle instead — dephasing only by 30 min daily instead of 1h, thus doubling the time spent in the range of the desired sleeping schedule).</li>
<li>Either the tau parameter can be changed, in which case:
<ul>
<li>delay chronotherapy might worsen circadian rhythm disorders such as DSPD into N24, as delaying might progressively extend the tau parameter and thus worsen the condition[2,35], studies showing that bigger taus are associated with worsened quality of life in circadian rhythm disorders [??]. But such adverse effects would also be reversible, perhaps at the cost of more stringent and uncomfortable sleep controlling measures, but still they would be reversible.</li>
<li><b>and more importantly, advance chronotherapy might be a potential curative treatment for circadian rhythm disorders</b>: although arduous since the range of entrainment and effect for advancing is more limited in humans (max 1h, but usually much less), daily advance in the PRC would eventually result in advancing the tau parameter to the desired value, closer to 24h. This would be the only mechanism known to durably reduce the circadian rhythm cycle.</li>
<li>The population that might suffer from non24 might be much wider than previously thought, requiring only that the given the conditions are met. Indeed, if the tau parameter can be behaviorally or chemically changed, combined with the well-known fact that human's circadian rhythm is naturally above 24h and thus free-running, this would suggest that anybody could potentially acquire the non24 syndrome. Contrarywise, previous studies on variable night shift work found that some chronotypes, mostly the early birds, have more difficulties adjusting to change in their sleep schedule[15, 27, 38]. A few studies on the NASA personnel explored the possibility to enforce a non24-like free-running schedule of 24.65 hours for 78 days, in order to assess the potential impact of future human cosmonauts who would go on a mission to Mars. These studies found that most of the personnel had major difficulties adjusting to this new schedule, with inefficient sleep even past the 78 days. These studies however did not assess the initial chronotype of the participants[22, 23]. Indeed, it's known that the early bird chronotype might partially determined by a genetic mutation[??]. All these preliminary evidences combined suggest that, in the case that the tau parameter is modifiable behaviorally or chemically, genetic mutations and predispositions are probably another contributing or discontributing factor to acquire non24. The early bird genotype might be a barrier preventing free-running and proper synchronization to zeitgebers, much like a genotype of zeitgebers hypersensitivity would on the contrary facilitate non24 acquisition by essentially making these subjects more susceptible to environmental factors[12, 13, 25, 28]. Furthermore, other genotypes might innately produce an increased tau, just as much as, in this hypothesis, behavioral adaptations might also delay the tau enough for entrainment to a 24h cycle being outside of the ROE[32]. In addition, sleep deprivation has been shown to modify the genotype by inducing genetic mutations, thus, specific lifestyles might induce genetic mutations causing or worsening circadian rhythm disorders such as non24[??]. Thus, it is conceivable that there is a two-way interaction between genetic mutations and behavior/lifestyle, both influencing each other. And actually, these complex interactions between environmental and endogenous factors have already been suggested to explain the difficulties in adaptation of night shift workers[15, 41]. Further studies on these interactions might yield extraordinary insights into the physiopathology of circadian rhythm disorders.</li>

</p>

<p>
Despite the focus of most studies on the master clock, there is evidence that the sleep-wake rhythm is dictated not only by the master clock but by several pathways in the peripheral nervous system (ie, in the whole body).[47, 48, 49, 50] Indeed, there are several evidences of the implication of mistimed food intake impacting the circadian rhythm[51], which can in turn influence insulin sensitivity[52], and even the composition of the diet can cause disruptions in the circadian rhythm[53]. This can have dire consequences, as mistimed sleep, without direct sleep deprivation, can increase the risk for various metabolic diseases such as diabetes and even alter the human transcriptome. (TODO: extend and add refs, process refs in [54]).
</p>

<h3>A new combined therapy</h3>

<br>

<p>
Leveraging the natural tendency of humans to delay more easily, we here propose a new combined therapeutic strategy, aiming to at least enhance the individual's quality of life by teaching how to exert more control on the sleep schedule, while minimizing or avoiding altogether sleep deprivation, which can have lasting effects from the very first night of sleep deprivation[??]. This strategy involves both a chronotherapy to allow the subjects to learn how to exert some control on their internal clock, as well as ... therapy (luminotherapy, dark therapy, sound therapy?) to control external cues as needed, as well as self reporting using computerized tools to help the user both track and also follow through the whole process.
</p>

<p>
This strategy allows to test the two hypotheses of the tau adaptation, and get benefits in either cases: at worst, if the tau parameter cannot be changed, the strategy allows the individuals to exert more control on their PRC and thus sleep phases and quality of life via an individually adapted chronotherapy and sleep hygiene ; at best, it allows to reduce or might even eliminate the circadian rhythm disorder by progressively reducing the tau parameter until it gets closer to 24h to allow entrainment.
</p>

<p>
The strategy involves two stages:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>control of internal clock by extending/delaying the PRC (chronotherapy) + elimination/reduction of potentially influencing external cues → see chronotherapy below.</li>
<li>stabilizing the internal clock by avoiding extension/delaying of the PRC + restoration/simulation of external cues as needed to complement the target PRC</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Such a combined therapy was suggested as a very promising approach to investigate[2, 15], however it was never done before to this extent and data is lacking.
</p>

<p>
All the calculations below will use the wake up time as the reference point to estimate the DLMO and the circadian rhythm of the individuals, which was found to be an accurate proxy for the DLMO, contrary to the bedtime which was not predictive of the DLMO in healthy volunteers[6, 14]. Furthermore, we will not follow current recommendations of various health organizations about the timing of melatonin administration, as they were shown to be ineffective, but rather use the latest evidence from research experiments:
</p>

<p>
«Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.»[16]
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, moving the participant's sleep schedule directly to the target sleep schedule at once has been shown to be not only ineffective, but also harmful by causing sleep deprivation. In effect, although the participant might forcefully wake up at the required time by using a device like an alarm clock, the circadian rhythm will behind the walls slowly drift in a free-running fashion until attaining the target time, meanwhile the desynchrony between the sleep schedule and the internal circadian rhythm decreasing the sleep efficiency as evidenced by polysomnography and ultimately sleep deprivation, as observed in both normal sleepers and non24 patients[2 with footnote 36 and footnote 37].
</p>

<p>
TODO: justify using literature on dsps and night shift work disorder: sighted non24 is very rare or misdiagnosed so litterature sparse, it is arguable whether all circadian rhythm disorders have shared mechanisms, with hints indicating that's true because melatonin work for all and sleep is a very conservated mechanism so likely it's a very stable process throughout evolution with some inter species and inter individual variability.
</p>

<h4>Stage 1</h4>

<br>

<p>
Before starting the Stage 1 of this protocol, it is crucial for the participant to both get diagnosed properly by a specialist physician in circadian rhythm disorders, and to rest properly for at least 2 weeks by following his/her own sleep schedule. The latter might not be as easy as it sounds: chronic sleep deprivation causes a decrease in cognitive performance that is not perceived properly by the subject, which means that subjects that are sleep deprived, which is a common occurrence for persons with the non24 syndrome, will have more difficulties to know when they need to sleep and how  to adapt their behavior to help inducing sleep (which is a big part of the Stage 1 process).[24, 29, 31] Hence, a period of stabilization in the sleep schedule (in the sense that the natural free-running sleep schedule is following to the participant's needs) is essential for the proposed therapy to have any efficiency. This "pre-protocol" period can be advantageously used to order the necessary equipment as well as put in place good practices such as systematically maintaining a sleep log with the help of applications such as Sleepmeter (more about that below). Also, participants should be cautioned that they may be left in a worse condition if they do not follow through the whole protocol (stages 1 and 2).
</p>

<p>
time management is crucial, but more difficult even for night shift workers: «It is common to feel like there is too much to do and not enough time, especially when working the night shift. Prioritize your sleep by blocking off that time first, then determine what else must get done, assign a time for those activities, and delegate or postpone other tasks. We do not routinely decide to pull all-nighters when working days; working nights is not the time for it either. Sleep should not be an afterthought.» <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a>
</p>

<p>
Stage 1: Delaying phase chronotherapy to reach the target wake up time: The chronotherapy involves an alternating strategy on 2 days, for 8 days:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>delay on day 1: extend the sleep onset by 3 hours (ie, sleep 3 hours later than the usual, or can calculate 4h subtracted from the sleep offset/wake up time if this one is more stable). Sleep as much as optimally needed to feel rested (X hours), and wake up at the new wake up time W. Eg: usual sleep time is from 5am to 1pm, on day 1 the new sleep time will be from 8am to 4pm (optimal sleep time of 8h), but the individual wakes up at 3pm instead (and sleeps less than the optimal 8 hours).</li>
<li>stabilize on day 2: sleep at W-X=O time until W time. Eg: the individual will sleep from 7am to 3pm, effectively having delayed by 2h.</li>
<li>Adjust and repeat for all subsequent days, and write down the time in a sleep log after each day. Adjusting consists in reducing/extending the delay depending on sleep efficiency:
<ul>
<li>if take time to sleep then too early, O time should be delayed.</li>
<li>if having too many nightmares (indicating more REM sleep than non-REM sleep), or wake up too early, then slept too late. O time should be advanced.</li>
<li>Hint: the temperature minimum is attained at the mid sleep time, thus when the individual is feeling colder, this might be a good hint that the PRC shape has begun.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stop this stage when the individual reaches a wake up time close to the target wake up time, with enough margin to account for a few days of continued delays. For this experiment, we advised 4 days of margin. Eg, if the individual's tau before the stage 1 was 24.5h, thus 30min delay each day, and the target wake up time was 9.00am, the stage 1 should stop when the individual wakes up at 7.00am, to allow for 4 days of delaying before reaching 9.00am. During this period, stage 2 will be started in order to attempt to maintain the individual's circadian rhythm in this phase. The number of days of margin can be adjusted depending on the amount of margin one wants to leave in order to adjust to stage 2.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
FIGURE 3: summarizing stage 1
</p>

<p>
During the application of the chronotherapy, it is essential to control a maximum of external parameters:<br>
<ul>
<li>At wake-up:
<ul>
<li>turn on bright lights (use a neon of white light — not yellow — for extended time and/or use luminotherapy lights for short time just after waking up)</li>
<li>Can take melatonin supplement to help delay further (although the effect might be paradoxical — it may not delay but advance, the effect of melatonin might be desynchronized compared to light in circadian rhythm disorders, this is a hypothesis advanced by some authors and there is currently no evidence in favor or against it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Before (1-2h at least) bedtime:
<ul>
<li>use blue and green light blockers glasses 2h before the planned sleeping time (such as Uvex Skypper S1933X or Uvex S0360X Ultra-spec 2000 [8] — it is also possible to precisely measure the light stimulation by using a spectrometer or new consumer-grade devices such as the Lys[9]).</li>
<li>stay in a place with minimum to no light intensity. Even with blue and green light blockers, the light intensity can still impact the circadian rhythm. Indeed, it was shown that even lux as small as 2-3 (candle lit dinner) suppress melatonin production [10].</li>
<li>avoid using electronic screens (except ebook readers with einks and no backlight). If really needed, set the backlight to the minimum, and use apps to turn the colors red, such as Twilight on Android. Any screen filter software that does not totally turn all colors to reddish is not filtering enough.</li>
<li>use an eye night cap to block a maximum of light during sleeping</li>
<li>go out of bed and do not go to the bed until it's the planned time to sleep (avoid working from bed! If you can't sleep, go out of your bed and come back half an hour later)</li>
<li>use noise blocking ear plugs during sleeping</li>
<li>turn off any sound or vibration notifications from phones and such</li>
<li>avoid practicing sport before bedtime, prefer to practice after waking up, during the first part of the (relative) day.</li>
<li>eat early at least 3h before bedtime, including beverages like coffee[30] or sugar drinks.</li>
<li>Other advices can be found in: <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" title="http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152" class="http">http://sci-hub.tw/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000152</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The maximum efficiency of this chronotherapy is a delay of 12h under 7 days (the 8th being for the final stabilization, which then should be followed by the strategy's stage 2, which is simply the continuation of this stabilization).
</p>

<p>
However, this efficiency can only be reached if the subject's internal clock can be entrained to a 27h day. DSPD patients were shown to be able to partially entrain[2], however, they did not fully entrain as shown by the reduced sleep efficiency in one of their subject towards the end of the chronotherapy delaying phase they used. In such a misentrainment case, the internal clock will revert to its natural tau (eg, 24.2h in humans on average), thus a delay will still occur but reduced, which will in practice result in a less efficient sleep and interruptions in the sleep (eg, waking up earlier than intended). However, when inducing an increased delay shifting, the free-running circadian rhythm might be bigger than the endogenous free-running rhythm without induction. For instance, in night shift workers, who were otherwise normal sleepers and thus probably with an average tau around 24.2h, it was observed that on average the circadian rhythm shift was about 1h, which would be a tau of 25h[41]. Our strategy tries to reduce this issue by allowing an alternating day of stabilization, whereas [2] chained the delays. It is also possible to adjust the number of delay hours by reducing it until the sleep efficiency is not impacted anymore.
</p>

<p>
Alternating days of delay and stabilization further provide a safeguard against the possibility of permanently extending the tau: by stabilizing, we try to ensure that the internal clock does not register the extension of tau as permanent but only as transient, as this was one of the raised concern about chronotherapies in circadian rhythm disorders[7].
</p>

<p>
For writing the time in a sleep log, we advise to use Sleepmeter Free combined with the Sleepmeter Widget by Squall Line Software[5], which are free tools on smartphones that simplifies the maintenance of a sleep log, with the additional benefit of being very precise: instead of writing the time at which you retrospectively think you went to sleep and woke up, the subject can simply tap a widget on the screen when going to sleep and when waking up. The software will then delimit the sleep times, with optionally a calculation of some offset time (eg, if the subject is a slow sleeper and takes 30 min before sleeping, or is drowsy in the morning and takes 20 min to wake up, it is possible to set up the software to automatically add or subtract such amount of time automatically from the "widget tap" times). Using such a software will allow the subject to both more precisely track its own sleep duration, timing and quality, but also provide an incentive for continuing the therapy (increasing therapy compliance). This can furthermore provide valuable data to the physicians and researchers, as sleep log data was shown to be highly predictive of the PRC, allowing to model it with 90% accuracy from sleep logs alone[6].
</p>

<p>
Napping was suggested to be advised to help in adaptation to zeitgebers by reducing sleep pressure and increase clock susceptibility to light[11], however this was not experimentally tested and there is evidence that napping reduces the sleep pressure and sleep duration during the bedtime sleep, making it more difficult by reducing sleep efficiency because of a lack of sleep pressure and slight sleep debt, which would otherwise ease falling asleep at the planned time[26, 39]. Also napping does not allow to cycle through all sleep stages in the same way that a full night of sleep does[40]. Furthermore, DSPS were found to have slower sleep pressure buildup compared to normal sleepers, and one can probably safely assume the same holds true for non24[15]. We thus disadvise napping in this phase unless required because of too much sleep deprivation (eg, because of a daily shift too big, in which case it should be reduced to allow for easier entrainment).
</p>

<p>
In any case, shifting might produce a more chaotic sleep schedule, as the forced behaviorally-induced shifting might not always be followed by a concrete shift in the circadian rhythm depending on various factors[33]. The participant should thus be prepared that this stage 1 might not be followed by a daily result, but should not be detracted from the overall result that the induced shifting produces (ie, the shifting should in the end be overall faster and allow the reaching of the target wake up time faster than by following the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm). In the worst case scenario, the participant will simply shift according to the endogenous free-running circadian rhythm, but at best, and with the help of environmental cues control such as light, the shift will be faster when following this protocol.

</p>

<h4>Stage 2</h4>

<br>

<p>
Stage 2: environmental cues control and melatonin administration to advance phase<br>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin B12 cyanocobalamin 1000mcg once per day, everyday (eg, Solgar brand). Vitamin B12 was shown to resolve a few sighted non24 cases and allow entrainment to a 24h schedule[55]. More recent studies evidenced a potential mechanism for this effect, with the B12 potentiating the magnitude of zeitgebers effects on the PRC (ie, B12 allows both light and melatonin — whether endogenous or exogenous — to have more shifting effect — whether advancing or delaying — on the circadian rhythm)[34].</li>
<li>For melatonin administration: use 1 pill <b>every few days (not everyday)</b> of <b>instant release</b> melatonin, dosed at 1.9mg. Instant release is VERY important. More details:
<ul>
<li>The optimal time to take the medication should be at the DLMO point - 4 hours[15]. To calculate the DLMO point = melatonin at wake up time - optimal sleep duration - 2 mod 24 [14]. Eg, if wake up time is 9am and the optimal sleep duration is 8 hours, the DLMO point will be at 9-8-2 = 11pm. From there, the optimal melatonin administration would be at 11-4 = 7pm. In practice, the melatonin should be taken between the optimal melatonin point and the DLMO, thus between 7pm and 11pm in our example, but NOT before 7pm (the melatonin point), as then the melatonin would have little to no effect before this point in the PRC phase.</li>
<li>Note that the bedtime, and DLMO, should not be calculated according to the target bedtime the subject would like, but rather, as suggested in previous reviews, according to the usual/expected bedtime if the subject follows the endogenous freerunning rhythm. The idea is to use melatonin as a tau shortener, in other words to advance the bedtime, and thus it should be adapted to the actual bedtime and not the wished one.</li>
<li>In this protocol, the melatonin administration is NOT daily, but every few days as required: when the individual uses melatonin at the optimal point (or close after), the PRC will be advanced. There is no currently available model that can predict the amount of advance that will thus be effected to any individual, but it can amount to less than a hour to several hours. Thus, the individual should take the melatonin when required to stay in a "range of target times": if for example the target time is to be awake by 9am, and the melatonin advance the PRC by 2h with a single dose, then the individual can take the melatonin when the wake up time gets close to 9am, to shift back to 7am, and then refrain from melatonin administration for a few days until the individual's circadian rhythm gets gradually close to 9am again. This way, the individual will always wake up between 7am and 9am, by using melatonin administration only when necessary. We also suggest this might also have the beneficial side consequence of avoiding habituation lessening effects that might happen with continuous administration of melatonin. If done properly, the wake up time should be irrespective of the bed time, although the individual should feel more sleepy earlier than the days prior, following melatonin administration.</li>

if you take a long release melatonin, it won't help much to go to sleep at the time you want, and in the morning you will feel more sleepy, because the melatonin will still be in effect<br>
long release melatonin is for those who take it as a relaxant<br>
(and I used both before knowing about the difference, and I can confirm, the long release ones do not work for us)

<ul>
<li>use night cap when you sleep</li>
<li>use blue blocker glasses 3 hours at least before you go to sleep [20]</li>
<li>use auditive blockers when you sleep</li>
<li>as before, control other environmental cues/zeitgebers:
<ul>
<li>eat at least 2/3 hours before bedtime</li>
<li>do NOT stay in bed if it's not to sleep: train your body to fall asleep faster by not staying in bed if it's not for sleeping! behavioral programming</li>
<li>exercise early in your day rather than later and avoid in the 3h before bedtime</li>
<li>avoid drugs, including alcohol</li>
<li>stick to your sleeping schedule: be rigorous with your sleeping schedule and hygiene: remember it is likely you have more sensitivity to delaying effects, thus you should be particularly careful to avoid anything that can delay your sleep (eg, evening/night time social events). Note however that social contacts and knowledge of clock time were found insufficient for entrainment, so although these can disrupt the sleeping efficiency, they are not sufficient to stick to a sleeping schedule[60].</li>
<li>avoid watching moving images (ie, videos) before sleep, prefer reading on an e-ink ebook or at worst a smartphone screen with a reddish screen filter and minimal backlight (ie, Twilight app on Android). Avoid using a laptop screen. Indeed, laptop screens tend to backlight more lux (ie, to project more light) compared to a smartphone, because a smartphone's screen is smaller and also for energy economy reasons they tend to allow a lower amount of intensity at the minimal setting than do laptop screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RECORD your sleep log with sleepmeter, including inputing when you used an accessory (night cap, blue blocker, etc)</li>
<li>Optional: expose yourself to bright light (lux &gt;= 3000) in the 4 hours following wake-up to induce more phase advance[43]. If your wake up time is during the day, you can expose yourself to sunlight (even if cloudy), but if not an artificial light with the appropriate lux intensity can be used. Note that most artificial lights can only project enough lux for phase advance at very close range. New devices such as the Luminettes are currently investigated to make the use of such artificial light therapy more comfortable and increase the rate of treatment compliance.</li>

<h3>Preliminary results</h3>

<br>

<p>
This section describes work-in-progress results that have not been statistically tested, they are <b>first-hand observations</b> on a <b>single case</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Smartphone-based sleeping log solutions may provide a quite accurate ground to predict phase shifts (and thus may help the subject in planning the next weeks or months of sleep schedules).</li>
<li>Accessories (sleep eye mask, ear plugs, blue blockers and blue light filters apps) seem to improve sleep efficiency (TODO: statistical test on difference in sleep length as a proxy for efficiency, else would need an actimeter or polysomnograph with and without).</li>
<li>Time-restricted feeding (skipping evening meal) may increase perceived tiredness at natural time to sleep (which in turns contributes to sleep efficiency). It may also somewhat reduce the phase shift.</li>
<li>Melatonin between 5 and 3 hours before calculated optimal bedtime (bedtime = 8 hours before last wakeup time) seems to have a similar, but stronger effect (to potentiate sensitivity to natural tiredness). It seems to phase advance bedtime, but not wakeup time (ie, the subject sleeps longer, but without any benefit, except as a "sleeping pill" when necessary).</li>
<li>Stage 1 procedure seems to indeed help in cycling faster. But stage 2 does not seem to stabilize.</li>
</ul>

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>

It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells. Also, a study in the journal SLEEP found that just one all-nighter resulted in signs of brain tissue loss.

«The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.21 The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure.22 Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.23 These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.»<br>

Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>

His sleep efficiency was only 19.5% on night 51, rising to a mere 41.6% on night 52, notwithstanding the significant level of prior sleep deprivation at that point. This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities. Such sleeplessness even under the favorable laboratory conditions of quiet isolation and absolute darkness verifies his reported difficulty sleeping at those desired hours.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>

«The strongest evidence of an influence of sleep homeostatic mechanisms on clock functioning comes from sleep deprivation experiments, demonstrating an attenuation of phase shifts of the circadian rhythm to light pulses when sleep homeostatic pressure is increased. The data suggest that the circadian clock is less susceptible to light when sleep pressure is high.»<br>
→ important toadd: means that any chronotherapy requires that the subject feels rested, as sleep deprivation will unoptimally reduce the efficiency of both the therapy and of sleep quality. A corollary is that before starting the chronotherapy, the subject should first try to sleep for a few days following his/her natural cycle, and with as many hours as necessary to feel optimally rested. To this effect, a chart of the average sleep duration per age can be found in [??].<br>
They suggest: «Adaptation to zeitgebers may be improved by introducing nap schedules to reduce sleep pressure, and through that increasing clock susceptibility to light.», but from my experience it just messes up things!<br>
Also ref for sleep pressure = homeostatic regulation of sleep: «Moreover, loss of sleep is followed by increased sleep indicating some kind of homeostatic regulation of sleep.»<br>

Sleep pressure concept from experiment: Dijk and Czeisler,1995 - but poorly understood, lacking data.<br>
Sleep debt stems from Borbely's work, or more precisely a homeostatic debt initially termed.<br>
Essentially, Borbely's model is that there are two sleep phases: the circadian sleep phase, modelled by the PRC, and the homeostatic sleep phase. The interaction of both is modelled by Borbely's. But the homeostatic sleep phase is poorly understood, apart from the fact that sleep deprivation, in other words a higher sleep pressure, leads to a lowered response to light. Thus, the sleep depriving strategy to resynchronize is not appropriate, and even reduces the chances in succeeding a delay shift.

There are thus lots of complex interactions in various processes pertaining to sleep, it is not simply a single process. Hence, there are lots of parameters, which interactions and effects are not entirely elucidated to this day, but we have already good evidence to think that they are useful for sleep regulation and potentially control.

Figure 2: «In an individual with DSWPD (B), DLMO occurs later than in a normal sleeper (A) and is potentially influenced by hypersensitivity to evening light, increased evening light exposure, and decreased morning light exposure. A delay in the phase of the circadian pacemaker and sleep-wake timing has been reported in patients with DSWPD, manifesting as a longer interval between CBTmin and sleep offset time, compared with normal sleepers (A). [...]  In healthy sleepers, the temperature minimum during sleep occurs w2 hours before sleep offset, whereas in DSWPD the temperature minimum has been reported to occur w4 hours before sleep offset.»<br>
BEST: DSPD have slower homeostatic sleep pressure buildup, they feel less. «Based on this association, dysregulation of the homeostatic sleep process may be an underlying mechanism that contributes to later sleep onset times in patients with DSWPD. As shown by Uchiyama and colleagues,56,57 sleep propensity during wake differs between patients with DSWPD and controls following sleep restriction, with patients with DSWPD accumulating homeostatic sleep drive at a slower rate compared with controls. In combination with slower homeostatic sleep drive accumulation, it has also been theorized that DSWPD symptoms may be influenced by slower dissipation of sleep pressure. Studies have reported that patients with DSWPD have longer habitual total sleep times compared with normal sleepers.»<br>

<b>BEST: melatonin optimal administration timing: «4 hours before DLMO induces a maximal phase advance</b> (Fig. 3C), whereas melatonin administration 12 to 15 hours after DLMO or up to 4 hours after waking is reported to induce maximal phase delays.80 A meta-analysis conducted in 2010 by Geijlswijk and colleagues81 investigating the efficacy of melatonin for DSWPD indicated that, compared with placebo, melatonin treatment advances endogenous melatonin onset by, on average, 1.18 hours, decreases SOL by 23 minutes, and advances sleep onset by 0.67 hours. Although this meta-analysis did not take dosage of melatonin into consideration, others have shown that a small dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg is as effective as 3 mg for advancing sleep onset.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884</a><br>
BEST: «Although pharmacopoeias and the European food safety authority (EFSA) recommend administering melatonin 1–2 h before desired bedtime, several studies have shown that melatonin is not always effective if administered according to that recommendation. Crucial for optimal treatment of CRSD, melatonin and other treatments should be administered at a time related to individual circadian timing (typically assessed using the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO)). If not administered according to the individual patient's circadian timing, melatonin and other treatments may not only be ineffective, they may even result in contrary effects. Endogenous melatonin levels can be measured reliably in saliva collected at the patient's home. A clinically reliably DLMO can be calculated using a fixed threshold. Diary and polysomnographic sleep-onset time do not reliably predict DLMO or circadian timing in patients with CRSD. Knowing the patient's individual circadian timing by assessing DLMO can improve diagnosis and treatment of CRSD with melatonin as well as other therapies such as light or chronotherapy, and optimizing treatment timing will shorten the time required to achieve results.» <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135" class="https">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079213001135</a><br>
BEST: dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) predicted by wake time and midpoint of sleep, but not bedtime. ME: so wake time (sleep offset) better to predict real bedtime and circadian rhythm than bedtime (sleep onset). <b>«The DLMO occurred about 2 hours before bedtime and 14 hours after wake. Wake time and midpoint of sleep were significantly associated with the DLMO (r = 0.77, r = 0.68 respectively), but bedtime was not (r = 0.36). The possibility of predicting young healthy normally entrained people's DLMOs from their sleep times is discussed.»</b>, The relationship between the dim light melatonin onset and sleep on a regular schedule in young healthy adults., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132</a><br>
<b>NOTE ME: all these parameters can be assumed to be on adults with an average sleeping duration of 8h (hence 14h after wake up = 2h before bedtime).

Summary: DLMO determination through objective measurements from saliva is better to do before treatment to optimize the treatment, but it's less adequate for n24 since it's constantly delaying.<br>
BEST: «DSPD patients had significantly later timed melatonin profiles that were delayed by approximately 3 h compared to normal sleepers, and there were no notable differences in the relative duration of secretion between groups. However, melatonin secretion between dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) and acrophase was less prominent in DSPD patients compared to good sleepers, who showed a more acute initial surge of melatonin following the DLMO. Although the regulatory role of melatonin is unknown, abnormal melatonin profiles have been linked to psychiatric and neurological disorders (e.g., major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, Parkinson disease). These results therefore suggest that in addition to a delayed endogenous circadian rhythm, a diminished initial surge of melatonin secretion following DLMO may contribute to the etiology of DSPD.», Nocturnal Melatonin Profiles in Patients with Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder and Control Sleepers., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26149168</a><br>

In both groups, a later initial melatonin phase was associated with a greater magnitude phase shift», Increased sensitivity of the circadian system to light in delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150</a><br>
→ BEST ME: Thus DSPD are more sensitivy to light phase delay shifts (31.5%!), less to melatonin surge secretion, and have slower sleep buildup (maybe due to less melatonin secretion) compared to normal sleepers. Also maybe why strong melatonin with immediate release is better, do not take long release melatonin (useless since duration is not different between controls and dspd). Since the PRC can be asymmetrical, the higher sensitivity to phase delay light (ie, closer to bedtime) gives no indication about light phase advance sensitivity, which might be lower than for good sleepers.<br>

Low-fat (carb diet) does not help (although it helps with weight loss), I tested for more than a year. Intermittent fasting neither although it helps a bit to nudge forward or backward (not really backward but slow the shift a bit).<br>
Good recent lay public article, keto (low-carb) can help with insulin management, for diabetics and obese (several studies!): <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html" class="https">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/style/self-care/keto-diet-explained-benefits.html</a><br>
If keto works, hypothesis is either that insulin signaling has more impact on circadian rhythm than previously thought, with some people such as non24 being particularly sensitive, maybe in particular it's pre-diabetic non24 people that are more sensitive? Or it can be because of gut dysbiosis, maybe candida albicans overgrowth that is stunted after some weeks of ketosis?<br>
Beware, very low carb may starve bacteria and in fact promote candida albicans overgrowth, because candida albicans has a mitochondria and thus can feed off from ketones, so better to have low carb (not very low)? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/8zbiwu/does_ketogenic_diet_make_candida_better_or_worse/e2i319u/</a> and <a href="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" title="https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/" class="https">https://digestivehealthinstitute.org/2015/04/09/dietary-control-candida-overgrowth/</a> - also this last link explains why too low carb will diminish/disable the immunity system, so actually it's very bad overall ,plus there is no evidence that apart in immunodepressive people, candida albicans can cause any chronic subtle issues (chronic candidiasis, or candida hypersensitivity), it's only proven to cause big issues and only in immunodepressed individuals, so if keto works for some non24, it's likely not because of "starving" candida albicans contrary to what alternative medicine proponents may claim: <a href="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" title="https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/" class="https">https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/</a><br>
If candida albicans, or in general gut dysbiosis, is the culprit for some non24, diagnosis from gut samples and probiotics may help then.<br>

"Stanford’s Dr. Gardner also says he sees one common misconception about keto: eating too much protein.

"It’s crucial, doctors say, to consult with a dietitian or physician, have cholesterol levels regularly checked, and replenish the fluids and sodium lost by increased urination and the severe restriction of carbohydrates. If not, within two to four days of beginning the diet, that depletion can bring on the “keto flu” — symptoms like dizziness, poor sleep and fatigue in some people." “Carbohydrates have a lot of nutrients that can help us maintain our body function,” said Dr. Prado. On the diet, some people experience “keto breath,” a halitosis likely caused by the production of acetone, which is one of the ketone bodies.<br>

<li>"This study demonstrates how a ketogenic diet strongly and specifically influences the endogenous clock and the circadian physiology of two different peripheral tissues: liver and intestine. Sleep-wake cycle, changes in body temperature, and hormone blood levels are just few daily patterns governed by the endogenous clock. Circadian (from the Latin “circa” = around, and “die” = day) rhythms are involved in sustaining important biological processes and their alteration, such as during shift-work or frequent transoceanic flights, can drastically perturb our physiology and health. Virtually, all the tissues of our body contain an internal clock, which synchronizes the specific tissue physiology to stimuli coming from the external world. Metabolic homeostasis and circadian clock functions are profoundly linked. Time of food and its composition, such as a western high fat diet, has been shown to affect the liver endogenous clock, impinging on its circadian rhythmicity both transcriptionally and metabolically. However, little is known about how the intestinal clock is affected by food and how different peripheral clocks specifically interpret a nutritional stress. [...] <b>Genome-wide analysis showed that PPAR-alpha target genes displayed a specific daily rhythmicity in the intestine upon ketogenic diet. Intriguingly, beta-hydroxyl-butyrate, an important metabolite produced by the activation of the ketogenic biochemical pathway, started to oscillate in the serum and the intestine with the same profile of PPAR-alpha target genes.</b>" <a href="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" title="https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous" class="https">https://www.hfsp.org/hfsp-news-events/nutrition-and-circadian-rhythms-how-ketogenic-diet-specifically-affects-endogenous</a> and <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" title="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4" class="https">https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/pdfExtended/S1550-4131(17)30500-4</a> and lay public summary (differential effect on intestine and liver, one is phase advanced, the other delayed): Ketogenic diet rewires circadian clock, Claire Greenhill, Nature Reviews Endocrinology <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129" class="https">https://www.nature.com/articles/nrendo.2017.129</a></li>

<li>BEST ME: initial idea back: shortening of tau + phase advance, use anything possible to do that, so can combine food and light for example, maybe multiple zeitgebers control has a cumulative effect? (ie, controlling food + controlling light = 2x phase advance and tau shortening than food or light alone).</li>
<li>Postprandial sleepiness (tiredness after eating, particularly at lunch, and particularly with high-carb diet/meal), is attributable to the effect of proteins increasing levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which itself promotes melatonin, the sleep hormone. In addition, carbohydrates help assimilation of tryptophan into serotonin. So a ketogenic diet is likely to increase vigilance, at the expense of mood issues, but may be alleviated maybe by complemeting with 5-HTP complement (but beware of serotoninergic syndrome, which is deadly!).

<li>"There is increasing evidence of a genetic component to N24. In most cases it is not a simple inherited genetic condition (Medelian inheritance). Most patients with N24 do not have parents or close relatives with the condition."</li>
<li>"However, there do seem to be several genetic factors which can predispose someone to the development of N24.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
One study found specific genetic changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in the gene BHLHE40 in 4 patients with N24. As this gene encodes components of the cellular clock, such mutations may affect clock function leading to the abnormalities noted in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
A separate study of 67 N24 patients found an association with polymorphisms in the PER3 gene. PER3 also encodes a crucial component of the circadian clock. The same polymorphisms were associated with extreme evening chronotype – a genetic predisposition to functioning better late in the day, a tendency which is also noted in Non-24s. Variations in the PER3 gene (both SNPs and repeat numbers) are believed to affect free-running period (in animals), the homeostatic drive for sleep (in humans) and the response to light (in humans). All of these factors have been hypothesized, with some evidence, to be abnormal in N24.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
DSPD, a condition related to N24, has been linked to the presence of a mutation in the CRY1 gene, which plays a role in the circadian clock, in a study of one family.
</div>
</p>

<p>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
Several genome-wide association studies – genetic screenings of over 100,000 persons — have shown genetic associations with human chronotypes. <b>While these studies did not involve N24 patients specifically, N24 is closely related to extreme evening chronotype, suggesting some of the same genetic factors may be relevant.</b>"

For example, based on the lowest body temperature time (you need to have device which gonna check and log your body temp) + 2h = DLMOff - average sleep duration - 1h = DLMOn. + ME: and I suspect that the "irregular sleep wake disorder" is simply non24 or DSPD that try to stick to unnatural rhythm - FALSE: for some non24 constrained to a non-natural schedule, yes that's the case but only transiently, but there are real cases of irregular sleep wake disorder where it's their natural rhythm, and it's totally different from non24!</li>

<li>Here is a very interesting study on 182 DSPD patients which found that half of them had no circadian rhythm misalignment (non-circadian DSPD), whereas those who had a misalignment (circadian DSPD) were more prone to depression.

Hopefully, future research should take into account the difference between circadian DSPD (ie, natural rhythm) and non-circadian DSPD (ie, acquired by behavior).</li>

<li>BEST ME: in discussion, propose there are several types of etiologies of non24, and each etiology has a different response to treatments: hyporesponse to light indicates a good response to strong light therapy, mistimed endogenous melatonin may indicate exogenous melatonin, and insulin hormone missignalling, potentially with insulin resistance and metabolic syndromes predisposition, may indicate the ketogenic diet to favor intestine's rhythm (regulated by food) over the liver's (regulated by insulin).</li>
<li>ME: good blue light filters also reduce luminosity, both go hand in hand. When blue light quantity and luminosity are both reduced enough, iris should be adapted to see in the dark, with looking at the electronic screen for an extended period having no impact.</li>

This is how the Uvex S0360X performs:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24_files/41I6gqnTN0L._SL1600_.jpg" width="300"><br>
Review for the Uvex S0360X: «As a researcher in the field of Sleep and Circadian Rhythms, I was ecstatic to find that people were using these glasses to improve sleep and adjust their circadian rhythm. For those who may not be aware, here's a brief explanation on why these would work: Our bodies are programmed to release melatonin during the night. With the advent of artificial light, we can expose our eyes to light during the night. When your eyes are exposed to light during night, melatonin release is shut down, disrupting your daily circadian rhythm (your brain thinks it's daytime when it is really night time), making it difficult to fall asleep. The receptors in your eyes that will convey the signal to halt melatonin release are most sensitive to light in the blue spectrum, providing an opportunity to prevent circadian disruption.
</p>

<p>
This does not mean that putting on these glasses in the middle of the day will make you fall asleep. I won't go into the details, but these will only be effective for people who stay up well past sunset (9:00 PM or later) and expose themselves to bright light (TV, computer, most room light). They could also be used by shift workers or people suffering jetlag trying to shift their circadian rhythms, but that is not simple, as there are many factors that go into modifying circadian rhythms correctly, and one could just as easily make things worse.
</p>

<p>
I try to wear these about an hour before bedtime, because I'm usually looking a computer screen or TV. By blocking out light, and specifically blue light, wearing these glasses helps me fall asleep much quicker, and prevents blue light from disrupting my circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
The only downside is you will look like a mad scientist wearing them around the house. Also, anything blue colored will look gray and I can not differentiate between yellow and white text (major problem for anyone playing Diablo 3).<br>
As another reviewer also mentioned, if you wear glasses, these won't easily fit over your glasses. It barely works for me, and I have small frames.»

<h3>Sleep deprivation</h3>

<li>“Studies show that over time, people who are getting six hours of sleep, instead of seven or eight, begin to feel that they’ve adapted to that sleep deprivation -- they’ve gotten used to it,” Gehrman says. “But if you look at how they actually do on tests of mental alertness and performance, they continue to go downhill. So there’s a point in sleep deprivation when we lose touch with how impaired we are.” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" title="https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T" class="https">https://www.businessinsider.com/10-ways-sleep-deprivation-affects-your-body-and-mind-2014-12?IR=T</a></li>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and brain damage</h3>

<p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll incur some minor brain damage.</li>
</ul>
It’s not really as bad as it sounds, but researchers at Stanford University and Washington Medical School have found that just one night of bad sleep is enough to raise levels of amyloid beta - a substance which clumps together creating plaque in your brain that’s toxic to nerve cells. Also, a study in the journal SLEEP found that just one all-nighter resulted in signs of brain tissue loss. Study researcher Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, said in a statement, “Our results indicate that a lack of sleep may promote neurodegenerative processes.”<br>

<h3>Sleep deprivation and weight gain/metabolic syndrome diseases</h3>

<li>Your insulin sensitivity will be a similar degree as if you had been on a high-fat diet for 6 months.</li>
</ul>
You read that right. According to a study out of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, one night of bad sleep lowers our body’s sensitivity to insulin in a similar degree as 6 months on a high-fat diet. A decrease in sensitivity to insulin or “insulin resistance” makes your body unable to keep blood sugar stable, which can eventually lead to Type 2 diabetes. (Note: The study was conducted on dogs, but it’s still very telling.)<br>

«In a survey of 612 high school students, the 63% who felt they needed more sleep on school nights showed a strong eveningness preference (as assessed by questionnaire), compared with students who described getting sufficient sleep.7 Other studies have revealed psychiatric morbidity (including affective and personality disorders), psychosocial impairment, and poor academic performance associated with the condition.»

<pre>
Sleep and wakefulness regulation
Conceptually, 2 processes govern sleep and wakefulness:

The homeostatic drive to sleep (process S) is proportional to the duration of sleep restriction and becomes maximal at about 40 hours.
Circadian regulation (process C) creates a drive for wakefulness that variably opposes process S and depends upon intrinsic rhythms.14
Neurons of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus exert master coordination of this sleep/wake rhythm, along with other behavioral and physiologic variables.15 Because the typical intrinsic period is slightly longer than 24 hours, synchronization to the 24-hour day (entrainment) is accomplished by environmental inputs (zeitgebers, or “time givers”), the most important of which is exposure to light.

<li>BEST: <b>sleep rescheduling strategies = Chronotherapy: does not work for DSPD?

«We postulated that patients with DSP insomnia had an inadequate capacity to achieve phase advance shifts of the circadian pacemaker which times the sleep-wake cycle. Chronotherapy was therefore designed to reset these patients' biological clocks by the phase delay route.»<br>
Also knew that hypnotics sleeping pills as a unitary treatment for all sleep disorders was a fallacy already in 1975s, and that they were bad for health: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
BUT makes sense that it should be easier, since human circadian clock is &gt; 24h, so delaying is easier than advancing and should ALWAYS be possible (but long term effect of being able to synchronize and MAINTAIN it is another story): This «is because delay shifts (in contrast to phase advances) are not solely dependent on the phase shifting capacity, but rather proceed in a direction common to the endogenous drift (Fig. 1) of the free-running human sleep-wake cycle. » <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a><br>
«This relatively rapid rate of phase delay was chosen to minimize the chance that the internal phase delay of the endogenous circadian system in response to the change of schedule would exceed the external phase delay shift being imposed. This would have only perpetuated the condition. Conversely, if the capacity of their circadian timing system to phase delay were exceeded on an i,mposed 27 hr day, the circadian rhythms in these patients would return to their presumably greater than 24 hr free-running period and therefore proceed in the same direction as their imposed rotation around the clock.»<br>
<ul>
<li>bouger d'un seul coup à l'heure visee ne fait que causer sleep deprivation: «Note that when his scheduled sleep episodes were acutely advanced to the times he desired (from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. on days 51 - 52), he spent almost all of both nights awake. His sleep efficiency was only 19.5% on night 51, rising to a mere 41.6% on night 52, notwithstanding the significant level of prior sleep deprivation at that point. This was also despite the factthat he was living in an environment free of time cues, unaware of the time at which we scheduled his activities. Such sleeplessness even under the favorable laboratory conditions of quiet isolation and absolute darkness verifies his reported difficulty sleeping at those desired hours.» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
<li>«It is of special interest to note that during this imposition of a 27 hr day, the patient's actual sleep became more and more interrupted toward the latter half of each bedrest episode. This is in marked contrast to the sleep records from the subject illustrated in Fig. 1 (days 21- 52), who continued to maintain consolidated sleep episodes while free-running on a 25.3 hr day.» → signe qu'on pousse trop, mais on peut forcer. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«These increasing periods of final awakening in case B indicate that the imposed day length of 27 hr (T = 27 hr) was beyond the upper limit of the ROE of his sleep-wake cycle (see Fig. 3). Fortunately, as we suggested earlier (in the Rationale), in such a circumstance the circadian rhythms of the patient should begin to free-run with a greater than 24 hr period. This indeed appears to have happened during stabilization (days 66-74), when the period of consolidated sleep extended a bit later into each scheduled sleep episode on successive nights, being nearly complete by the last three. These results highlight the importance of close adherence to the schedule during stabilization even if the patient encounters sleeplessness, since the rhythms are still in the process of reentrainment.» → confirme ce que j'ai testé. Donc pas ideal durant chronotherapy, sleep efficiency en prend un coup pendant 14j.<br>
<ul>
<li>«However, recent evidence (J. Elliott, personal communication) indicates that PRC amplitude can actually be affected by prior conditions. It is therefore conceivable that recurrent phase shifts may contribute to the condition of DSPS.» → à force de phase shifter on devient dsps avec plus de facilités à phase delay que advance? et avec reduced env cues on devient non24?</li>
<li>BEST: « Elegant experiments by the late John Mills and his co-workers (1978) <b>demonstrated that the measured circadian rhythms in nearly all normal subjects whose scheduled sleep-wake and light-dark cycles were advanced by 8 hr actually delay shifted 16 hr around the clock before resynchronizing.</b> This is exactly the result expected in those individuals whose capacity to phase advance has been exceeded. Further, after a 12 hr phase shift, they found that 90% of the partial adaptations proceeded by the phase delay route. Those results suggest to us that some normal individuals, without a PRC abnormality, might develop DSPS when forced to attempt an acute 6-8 hr phase advance (e.g., shift workers). Like Mills' normal subjects, some would be unable to achieve the shift by the phase advance route. However, unlike his subjects, who were living on a very strictly imposed schedule in temporal isolation, individuals living in society would also inadvertently prevent complete resynchronization via the phase delay route by "sleeping late" on leisure days (as in Fig. 4, days 1-20). Those episodes of late sleep might prevent their endogenous rhythms from drifting later and later around the clock, thereby effectively trapping the rhythms in a chronically inappropriate phase position (near its position before the imposed phase advance).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a></li>
</ul>
«Patients could be instructed to rigidly adhere to their desired, fixed bedtimes and wake times regardless of whether they slept during that period. They could then be assured that (like Mills' normal subjects discussed above), they would eventually adapt to the new schedule. However, it would be unlikely that most such patients would be able to adhere to the schedule during the prolonged period required (probably greater than 2 weeks) without very intense supervision. Even with such supervision, many would be unable to tolerate the discomfort resulting from sleep deprivation and internal dissociation (similar to the jet lag syndrome).» <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967</a> mirror: <a href="./SleepNon24_files/Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" title=".\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf" class="file">.\Chronotherapy Resetting the Circadian Clocks of Patients with DSPS.pdf</a><br>

<li>BEST: indeed chronotherapy might be dangerous! Might habituate the circadian clock to longer timeframes and thus the ROE gets way above 24h and can no longer advance, can only delay!

BEST WARNING ME: this is based on one study of someone who delayed his sleep phase BECAUSE of external stress factors, thus he was compensating, not doing a controlled chronotherapy. And it's not the chronotherapy that led to non24, it's the fact that while being delayed, the sleep efficiency decreased, thus the subject was not resting properly, and as a consequence the internal clock delayed continuously until finding the correct time to have a good sleep! So the interpretation is totally the opposite, and non24 might be a mechanism in fact to find the correct sleep schedule that maximizes sleep efficiency! Thus if not good sleep efficiency, the circadian clock will shift until finding a sweet spot! Thus sleep hygiene might be VERY important to prevent phase shifting and ultimately non24! <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6622881</a>

+ using hypnotics and stimulants not appropriate! + shifting can be a bit chaotic!<br>
«The circadian basis of N24HSWD distinguishes it from other sleep-wake disorders, and therefore use of hypnotics and stimulants to address the sleep and sleepiness symptoms, respectively, is not appropriate.21 The pattern of sleep disruption experienced by patients with the disorder does not always present as a shift in sleep timing each day. A majority of individuals will attempt to maintain sleep at a socially normal time. As a result, some individuals will produce a sleep pattern with the nocturnal sleep episode expanding and contracting as they move in and out of phase and with the build up and pay-back of homeostatic sleep pressure.22 Due to the pleomorphic variation in patient's sleep timing, a review of sleep history may not reveal a clear cyclic pattern to indicate the presence of N24HSWD.23 These more subtle cyclic changes are termed “relative coordination” and often require an expert to review.»<br>

Since DeCoursey's study, Phase response curves might have some differences but it's a highly conservated behavior in all species: «PRCs have been recognized as a universal feature of the mechanism of entrainment to all effective stimuli in a wide variety of species, from unicellular algae to primates.»<br>
Humans have a ROE (range of entrainment, which differs between species and individuals) from 23h to 27h → more range to delay than to advance! To advance, can only do so in increment of max 1h, whereas to delay can do up to 3h! (like in my strategy 5)<br>

Intermittent fasting can affect circadian rhythms in a different way depending on the timing of food availability, suggesting that this regimen affects the SCN clock, similarly to calorie restriction. SCN resetting by intermittent fasting and calorie restriction might be the answer to many chronobiologic misalignments, accounting numerous proofs for the health benefits conferred by these regimens.<br>
Significantly, affecting circadian rhythms impairs the metabolism and cause metabolic disease aetiology, suddenly declining glycaemic control, increasing the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. An acute circadian misalignment, for instance, may lift postprandial glucose concentrations by up to 20%, suggesting that preserving circadian coordination is crucial for metabolic welfare [65].<br>
Interestingly, research<br>
groups were able to demonstrate the perturbations of the biological clock during feeding and fasting and how they can intervene pharmacologically at this point. This model can be transposed into current practice by developing models that include the rhythm of diet and exercise to combat metabolic pathologies [17, 68, 85].<br>
Quintessential anabolic rhythms are noticeable in humans early in the morning or around noon, glucose tolerance is optimal, skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation and the thermic impact of food is more significant in the morning than in the night, leading to daytime being ideal for caloric intake and night time as ideal for resting and fasting, enhancing all secondary offensive mechanisms of glycaemic control and caloric balance, accordingly. On the other hand, the human circadian rhythm is not governed only by the day/night cycle. There is data in the literature and scientific studies demonstrating that a proper circadian rhythm modulates the function of organs. The most studied model is that of the liver due to its function important in maintaining energy homeostasis, being aware that it is under day-to-day diurnal storage and energy use.<br>
BEST: temperature peak-level in mid-day! And min during mid-night!<br>
"cyclic glucocorticoid production with peak levels early in the morning, are also determined by the SCN" -&gt; this may be why if you wake up not in your phase you will feel out of your mind!<br>
-&gt; Avoid high-fat diet!!! Can be partially reversed, but not totally: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366733</a><br>
There is a clear relationship between human dietary behaviour and circadian clockwork. The regular feeding-fasting cycles represent dominant synchronizing signals for peripheral clocks by initiating a series of molecular entrainment pathways, able to conduct the circadian routine. In contrast, disrupted feeding schedules can fully uncouple peripheral oscillators from the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, reinforcing the statement that metabolic cues, modulated by diet, reach and signal the SCN and modify specific output pathways of the clock [11, 29].<br>

But some people reported that it worked for them: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/e27vqn/carnivore_miracle/</a> so then to reduce health risks, use plant-based sources of fat, proteins and carbohydrates: <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext" title="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext" class="https">https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30135-X/fulltext</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4351995/</a><br>
-&gt; BEST definition of entrainment: "The master clock within the brain is a functional high-fidelity receiver that reacts to ambient light–darkness signals, being the central element of the synchronization mechanisms. Nevertheless, each cell of the body has a self-circadian oscillator, regulated by a master clock that converges to conferring rhythm to every cell and organ compelling a complete functional system, through excitation of rate-limiting control measures of metabolic programs, in order to accomplish the circadian control of the entire organism. Essentially, metabolic control is not a regular circadian system output feature, but signal exerted by nutrients intake, energy turnover and the redox status represent precise feedback for cellular clocks. The circadian clock is intimately connected with the metabolic pattern, at all cellular organization and developmental levels, any insignificant misalignment in their communication channels efficiently deriving to a plethora of pathologies [44, 53]. Circadian clocks generate a high-fidelity inner projection of external temporal records by creating a cellular and whole organism dynamic environment that oscillates rhythmically at approximately 24 hours. Besides prompting daily rhythms, circadian clocks are sensors for environmental data that enable them to stay synchronized with day-night alterations, light and dark, hot and cold, as well as all the resources that rely on these modifications, primarily food convenience. Molecular oscillators generate 24-hour rhythmicity at the cellular level based on transcriptional-translation processes, metabolic feedback loops or their interaction. The temporal platform, which coordinates all functions to be performed at the right time within the 24-hour day, involves many interacting oscillators, all of which are part of the active synchronization process portrayed as entrainment [18, 52]. Any environmental factor that varies within the 24- hour day potentially can serve as an entraining signal, called zeitgeber. In the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a minuscule region of the brain in the hypothalamus, located directly above the optic chiasm, the dual function of circadian clocks as rhythm generators and sensors is particularly evident: it produces circadian rhythms in many of its cells, but also as a neuronal network it entrains these rhythms into the light-dark cycle through retinal feedback [23]. The SCN, often referred to as the primary pacemaker of the mammalian circadian system, serves predominantly as a relay station that transmits light and darkness data to additional oscillators present in the body by generating endogenous entrains, embodied at the molecular, physiological and behavioural level. As a central pacemaker, the SCN controls melatonin's pineal synthesis, but in the meantime, it reacts to melatonin itself, having regulatory potential on the core body temperature's daily rhythm."<br>

"A diurnal rhythm of eating-fasting promotes health, but the eating pattern of humans is rarely assessed. Using a mobile app, we monitored ingestion events in healthy adults with no shift-work for several days. Most subjects ate frequently and erratically throughout wakeful hours, and overnight fasting duration paralleled time in bed. There was a bias toward eating late, with an estimated &lt;25% of calories being consumed before noon and &gt;35% after 6 p.m. "Metabolic jetlag" resulting from weekday/weekend variation in eating pattern akin to travel across time zones was prevalent. The daily intake duration (95% interval) exceeded 14.75 hr for half of the cohort. When overweight individuals with &gt;14 hr eating duration ate for only 10-11 hr daily for 16 weeks assisted by a data visualization (raster plot of dietary intake pattern, "feedogram") that we developed, they reduced body weight, reported being energetic, and improved sleep. Benefits persisted for a year."

<li>BEST: melatonin affects POMC gene, serotonin activates MC4 receptors, and both melatonin and serotonin are interdependent! "The administration of exogenous melatonin in rats has been reported to induce the expression of the POMC gene in the ARC. [...] The rhythm of the activity of serotonin neurons is also shown as circadian changes, with a clear downward trend during the dark phase and an increase during the light phase. The changes were revealed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), hypothalamus and striatum; and these changes are likely the result of interactions between melatonin and serotonin. Anatomic proof of the existence of direct dependence between these two hormones is demonstrated through the proximity of their receptors in the DRN. The inhibitive impact of exogenous melatonin on the immunoreactivity of serotonin neurons in the DRN was observed, and the receptor of melatonin type 1 (MT1) acted as an agent in this effect.

"After eating -- particularly sugary foods -- insulin is produced by the pancreas which then converts these sugars (glucose), circulating in the bloodstream into glycogen within our cells," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"Excessive secretion of insulin causes the essential amino acid tryptophan to move into the brain. Once in the brain, it leads to increased production of serotonin and melatonin, which are two neurotransmitters that have a calming effect and help regulate sleep. Interestingly, around 90 percent of the body's serotonin is found in the gut, where it regulates intestinal movements."
</p>

<p>
Accredited practising dietitian Jemma O'Hanlon agrees, saying the amount of carbohydrates we eat at lunch can affect how sleepy we feel afterward.
</p>

<p>
"Carbohydrate containing foods such as bread, pasta, rice and potatoes boost the production of a neurotransmitter known as serotonin, which can boost our mood but also make us feel content and possibly sleepy," O'Hanlon told HuffPost Australia.
</p>

<p>
"It's often when we've eaten quite a large meal that we may feel uncomfortable and sluggish, as well, so it's always good to listen to our hunger signals and stop when we feel comfortably satisfied."
</p>

<p>
Another factor that may contribute to drowsiness after a meal is if you suffer from a food allergy or intolerance.
</p>

<p>
"Food allergies and intolerances are usually associated with digestive problems such as bloating, gas, reflux, indigestion, constipation or diarrhoea, as well as lethargy," Clark said.
</p>

<p>
"For example, you've probably heard or experienced that turkey can make you sleepier than other foods. Turkey and other high protein foods such as spinach, soy, eggs, cheese, tofu and fish contain higher levels of tryptophan. Studies have shown that cherries (particularly sour cherry) affects melatonin levels, which is the hormone responsible for inducing sleep."
</p>

<p>
Another sleepiness inducing food is white bread, particularly when compared to whole grain, wholemeal or multigrain bread.
</p>

<p>
"When you consume white bread your body quickly absorbs the fibre-less starches and refined sugars rapidly, which causes a spike your blood glucose levels. This spike is short lived and results in plummeting blood glucose levels, which can lead to feelings of tiredness and sleepiness," Clark said.

</p>

<p>
An amino acid called tryptophan, which occurs in many protein-rich foods, helps the body produce serotonin. Carbohydrates help the body absorb tryptophan.<br>
<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" title="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating" class="https">https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323379.php#why-do-people-feel-tired-after-eating</a>
</p>

<p>
SUMMARY: proteins increases levels of tryptophan and then serotonin, which by itself makes us drowsy after lunch and additionally promotes secretion of melatonin, the sleep hormone. Carbohydrates (glucides) help the body absorb tryptophan and thus secrete serotonin. So low-fat, high-carb, high-protein food increases serotonin naturally. Low-carb, low-protein, high-fat (ketogenic) diet on the other hand avoid serotonin secretion and thus can lead to improved energy levels (at the expense of mood?). -&gt; so if really difficult to stay on low-carb because of mood issues, try taking 5-HTP complement (but then probably reduced phase advance effects).
