<h2>VLiDACMel therapy</h2>

<br>

<h3>Foreword</h3>

<p>
This is an experimental protocol for entrainment of treatment resistant sighted non24. This will evolve over time, as this protocol is still under experimentations. This was not tested yet on more than one subject.
</p>

<p>
Check out later this article for updates, including: whether keto diet is necessary, blue blocker <i>sun</i>glasses, more accurate circadian rhythm estimation using continuous body surface temperature with affordable clinical-grade wearables.
</p>

<p>
For the moment, I advise to skip the therapy section unless you are really curious, and rather go directly to the TROUBLESHOOTING section, which aims to answer the most common questions about the various therapies for non24.
</p>

<p>
Also, this therapy was designed for sighted non24. Since the tools influencing the circadian rhythm are the same for all humans (and actually most research was done on typical sleepers but are applicable for people with circadian rhythm disorders), some parts may also be applicable to DSPD with some changes (mostly that the goal of DSPD is to phase advance gradually, whereas non24 aims to freeze the circadian rhythm in place with a treatment-induced daily phase advance that counteracts the natural intrinsic daily phase delay).
</p>

<p>
<b>DISCLAIMER: this protocol is not scientifically peer-reviewed and not clinically validated. It was tested on only 2 individuals with non24 since birth and under a controlled home environment. Hence this protocol cannot be formally recommended, it should still be considered experimental and maybe risky</b> and I have yet to confirm whether all the things I did are really necessary or not, and the safety is not guaranteed. If you do try, you do it at your own risks (please ask a physician to follow you at least!).

This draft was written by Stephen Karl Larroque starting from February 2020. Last update: June 2020.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
TL;DR: I have a non24 circadian rhythm disorder, I followed a combination therapy I designed, and this is the result:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/pasted_image001.png"> 
</p>

<p>
Zoomed out, here is my full sleep diary over 1 year, with the working therapy at the end:<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/sleepmeter_daily_period.png" width="700">
</p>

<p>
I was entrained for 2.5 months, which is significantly much more than anything before (all previous attempts failed after 2 weeks). This was with 1h light therapy at wake up, but not very long light therapy of 3-5h.
</p>

<p>
TODO: add new results of new experiment with very long light therapy, 1 more month of entrainment and it's continuing. With additional result of staggering reduction of circadian period tau under 24h at 23.5h. Everything else was held constant, only light therapy duration was extended to reduce the circadian period under 24h.
</p>

<p>
Before I tried: 1- melatonin only, 2- light therapy lamps + melatonin, 3- strict ketogenic diet only with timed meals (time-restricted feeding), 4- intermittent fasting (or even complete fasting for a few days), 5-carbs-only diet, and of course strict sleep hygiene, but none of those worked.
</p>

<p>
My latest protocol, which worked for 2.5 months at the time of this writing, is named <b>VLiDACMel</b>, which stands for: <b>V</b>ery long <b>Li</b>ght therapy at wake-up, <b>D</b>ark therapy in the evening, <b>A</b>void <b>C</b>arbs and <b>Mel</b>atonin mixup, and take exogenous instant-release <b>Mel</b>atonin timed before DLMO (through core body temperature).
</p>

<p>
The threshold to consider any treatment effective was set to 1 month of entrainment, entrainment being defined as an average wake-up time under 1 ultradian cycle (a time window of 1.5-2h), such as wake up between 9am and 11am.
</p>

<p>
This therapy can be summarized in 3 points:<br>
<ul>
<li>Light exposure control: light therapy glasses Luminette at wake-up (or another light source of 500lux with optimized light angle to stimulate ipRGCs in the nasal retinal hemiregion) to phase advance and hence reduce circadian period (biological day duration). The exposure must be "very long", so use for 3-5h from wake up using relatively low intensity bright light of 500 lux. Light therapy must always be combined with dark therapy in the evening (ie, avoidance of light exposure to avoid unwanted phase delay), by using blue light filters and dimming the brightness of any light emitting device/lamps (or use blue blocker sunglasses if environmental light sources cannot be controlled).</li>
<li>Melatonin instant release pills, taken at a time calculated relatively to DLMO. This both consolidates sleep (ie, ensures you sleep your full night and not wake up too early or in the middle of your night causing unwanted sleep deprivation) and phase advance. The effect is additive with light therapy.</li>
<li>Food timing and composition control: reduce/minimize carbohydrates intake, and avoid them after melatonin intake. In the experiment above, I was half the time under a strict ketogenic diet, and half under a balanced diet including carbs.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Full protocol</h3>

<br>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Preparation the two weeks before doing this new therapy: sleep without alarms to fulfill your sleeping needs, and wait for your circadian rhythm to shift naturally until it's close</li>
</ul>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
1- Sleep according to your own natural rhythm for 2 weeks. If necessary, buy an eye mask and ear plugs to prevent external factors from disrupting your sleep. This is necessary to stabilize your sleep and circadian rhythm before starting the therapy.<br>
2- Write down your wake-up time and falling asleep time every day in a journal (use Sleepmeter on Android). This will serve 2 purposes: you can get a formal diagnosis from a specialized sleep doctor with 2 weeks of sleep logs showing a non24 pattern, and it also allows you to better know what affect your sleep and better know your own sleep patterns. Indeed, it's not uncommon that we overestimate the duration of our sleep, and for non24 individuals the daily phase delay (ie, it's often shorter than you think).<br>
3- Take this opportunity to get to better listen to your body and recognize the signs of sleepiness tiredness signalling your body is ready to sleep. It takes at least 2-3 days of good sleep (good duration AND circadian alignment) for the body to recover and feel fully working. For individuals with non-24, this can be a genuinely new experience to NOT feel sleep deprived, since they only lived under sleep deprivation before. It is extremely helpful to know what it's like to not be sleep deprived, and to learn to differenciate when you are sleep deprived and when you are not, as it will help in knowing when to adjust the treatments timing and dosage for you.<br>
4- After the 2 weeks, calculate the average wake-up time over the last 3 days. Subtract the sleep duration you need to feel the most refreshed after sleep (usually 7-8h for adults) + 2 hours from this average wake-up time to compute the DLMO (dim-light melatonin onset). Example: if the average wake-up time over 3 days was 6am, and you need 7h of sleep to feel refreshed, your DLMO is at 6-7-2 = 9pm. Subtract 2-4 hours from this DLMO time to get the ideal time window to take melatonin. Using the previous example, the melatonin intake window would be between 5-7pm.<br>
5- Now, wait for your sleep to cycle and come close to the ideal time you would like to freeze in-place. Indeed, there is no proven way to cycle backward (ie, wake up earlier and earlier), but if you phase advance enough, you'll eventually reach the wake-up time you would like (this is called a phase delay chronotherapy). If you are too eager and start the therapies below out of phase with your circadian rhythm, this will not work and may worsen sleep deprivation temporarily. Start the next steps below when your wake-up time is around 2-4h before the ideal time you would like to wake up. Meanwhile, continue to write a sleep log.

<p>
<ul>
<li>After the 2 weeks of natural sleep, use now this combination of therapies everyday, laid out here in chronological order of use during the day, and the major steps emboldened:
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li><b>Very long light therapy: use 500 lux bright light therapy at wake-up for 3-5h with an angle towards your nose to "freeze" your circadian rhythm by constant phase advance or even reduce circadian period to less than 24h. Also stops melatonin production and increases vigilance and mood. This is the strongest tool to manipulate the circadian rhythm.</b> Use light therapy glasses such as Luminette for 3-5h directly as soon as you wake up. The lowest setting, 500 lux, is sufficient with the Luminette. If you have troubles turning on the light because it's too bright and burning your eyes, try first the lowest intensity with your eyes closed for a few minutes. Your eyes will adapt, even if your eyelids are closed. After a few minutes, you should be able to open your eyes. If the glasses turn off before 1h, turn them on again to continue. TODO REWRITE: any bright light should be sufficient, even cheap white light neons, but need to target either <a href="https://n.neurology.org/content/76/16/1422" title="the parafoveal or nasal region of the retina" class="https">the parafoveal or nasal region of the retina</a> as these regions much <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="more effectively suppress melatonin" class="https">more effectively suppress melatonin</a>, and to use at wake-up. Bright light therapy is even more important if you use more than 1mg of melatonin (supraphisiological levels), because there will be residually higher levels of melatonin next morning that will cause drowsiness, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="bright light therapy can forcefully inhibit that" class="https">bright light therapy can forcefully inhibit that</a>. Light is likely the most powerful tool we have to control the circadian rhythm, as it was shown in animals that <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="light can entrain even without a pacemaker" class="https">light can entrain even without a pacemaker</a>. Light also <a href="https://www.psio.com/pdf/pro/How-to-increase-serotonin-in-the-human-brain.pdf" title="increases serotonin levels and hence vigilance," class="https">increases serotonin levels and hence vigilance,</a> since <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="light impacts both the circadian rhythm C and the homeostatic (sleep pressure) process S" class="https">light impacts both the circadian rhythm C and the homeostatic (sleep pressure) process S</a> (which makes sense since <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="cordycepin" class="https">cordycepin</a>, an adenosine analog and adenosine being the biological basis of the homeostatic process S, has a huge impact on the circadian rhythm C, showing that both processes are inter-dependent).

<li>Timed big main meal, which is to take your main meal at the middle of your circadian rythm's day. This synchronizes your circadian rhythm thanks to your intestines regulation of the circadian clocks (it's the biggest producer of melatonin). You can eat a breakfast, but it should be relatively small, and there should be only one big meal during the day (eg, the sort of meal that you feel like you ate enough for the whole rest of the day - but be careful of not over-eating!). More than entraining your circadian rhythm, timing meals allows to avoid circadian misalignment, as eating food during your biological night or too close to it can impair several regulatory functions such as insulin and glucose. This is true not only for non24 and DSPD but also for typical sleepers as well, although the former may be even more at risk due to a mutation in melatonin type 2 receptor (MT2) which seems to be more prevalent in individuals with a circadian rhythm disorder.
<ul>
<li>DEPRECATED: not necessary (but can be hepful): Follow a strict ketogenic diet with timed big main meal. The effects will start only after you reach the highest 2 levels on the ketostix (measurements of ketosis from urine): Reduce the quantity of consumed carbohydrates, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084345/" title="as each 1% reduction improves the metabolism and reduces risks of obesity and metabolic disorders, including sleep" class="https">as each 1% reduction improves the metabolism and reduces risks of obesity and metabolic disorders, including sleep</a>. Following a strict ketogenic diet is kind of the extreme of this strategy, which has the additional advantage of reducing the sleep duration (by one ultradian cycle, so about 1h30-2h) while improving sleep quality (so there is no loss in sleep even if the duration is smaller, which eases the maintenance of a stable sleep), reduce hunger (eases the avoidance of the detrimental melatonin/insulin/carbs interaction in the evening) and increases the time resetting effect of food (by increasing the intestines time clock gene expression and switching off liver's time clock genes and melatonin production - in other words your peripheral circadian clocks will rely more on your food timing, which is a lot easier to control than other zeitgebers). A strict ketogenic diet is a diet with &lt;=50g of wet carbs (sugar+fibers), including &lt;= 20g of sugar carbs per day. This can be tested with a simple urine test using the ketostix. Note that a ketogenic is mostly composed of fat, and only mildly with proteins, do not compensate for the lack of carbs by eating too much proteins, as they will get converted to carbs, preventing you from reaching the highest levels of ketosis as indicated by the last 2 colors on the ketostix. If you choose to do a ketogenic diet, plan to start it ahead, at least 2 weeks before the rest of this protocol, as to have enough time for your sleep to adapt and stabilize with the new diet. Also make sure to use vitamins and minerals complement to avoid the risk of electrolytes insuffisance contributing to the dreaded keto flu. The most effective version of my therapy was with a strict ketogenic diet, so you should probably try that at first and if this works you can then try to transition back to a more complete diet with carbs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Kickstart your melatonin production with a melatonin pill and hence sleep and help its consolidation</b>: take melatonin in instant release form (the dosage is not important, can be as low as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/86/10/4727/2849013" title="0.1mg" class="https">0.1mg</a> or up to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="3mg" class="https">3mg</a>, but only doses &gt; 1mg can produce hypothermia and hence greater phase advancing effects). What also matters is that it dissolves in sublingual instantly - if you can't find an immediate/fast release melatonin, you can use long/prolonged release melatonin but <a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/melatonin.html" title="crushed" class="https">crushed</a> to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5108473/" title="avoid the coating (parent compound) from delaying the melatonin intake" class="https">avoid the coating (parent compound) from delaying the melatonin intake</a>) during the ideal melatonin window time you calculated before. Melatonin not only helps with phase advance, but also consolidates the 2nd part of your sleep, so you are more likely to sleep your full night rather than be woken up earlier because of various disturbances.</li>
<li><b>No food nor caloric drink past melatonin intake time, to prevent food/glucose from interacting with melatonin</b>: after you take melatonin or when it's too late and you think melatonin is produced by your body, do NOT eat any glucose, and if possible any calories at all. But 0% drinks are allowed. Research has shown that glucose is processed worse when melatonin is present in the body, which can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="lead to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes" class="https">lead to metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes</a>, and we suspect circadian rhythm disorders.

This strategy is kind of, but not exactly like, a time-restricted feeding schedule, but instead of restricting by time, you restrict by when you expect melatonin in your body.</li>
<li><b>Prevent light from interfering with melatonin production by using dark therapy blue blocker sunglasses 2-4h before natural bedtime</b>: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="light can suppress both melatonin and shift the circadian rhythm" class="https">light can suppress both melatonin and shift the circadian rhythm</a> (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="independently of whether melatonin is suppressed," class="https">independently of whether melatonin is suppressed,</a> see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Suppressing melatonin by light can reduce the carry-over hangover when taking a supraphysiological dose because of the <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194" title="photic history" class="https">photic history</a> (see also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="here" class="https">here</a>) and because <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6928018/" title="light eliminates melatonin faster than natural elimination" class="https">light eliminates melatonin faster than natural elimination</a>.

A blue blocker sunglasses such as UVEX amber glasses and manually tinted in black is a very easy way to do both without any more hassle. If you don't have access to such glasses, a more inconvenient and less reliable but working alternative is to modify the environment: dim down / switch off all lamps (including your computer screen intensity) and install blue light filters softwares on your computer (advised: LightBulb or f.lux) and smartphone (Twilight on Android). If you have a changing color LED lamp (eg, Living Colors), use it as a bed lamp by setting it to full red color (the blue LED should be switched off if you selected an appropriately full red color). Why start the dark therapy 2-4h before target bedtime? Because melatonin takes 1-2h to produce drowsiness effects from its DLMO point, and it takes 1-2h for melatonin production to reach it's DLMO level from the moment it starts its production (or from when the light inhibition/exposure is stopped). Hence, the dark therapy should be started 2-4h before the natural bedtime. Whereas light therapy phase advances your circadian rhythm (ie, you wake up earlier), dark therapy prevents unwanted phase delays due to light exposure, which concretely makes you feel more fatigued at the wanted time.</li>
<li>Optimize sleep preparations and hygiene:
<ul>
<li><b>Use an eye mask and ear plugs (or a white/pink noise machine) to reduce the highly detrimental effect of noise and disturbances on your sleep efficiency</b>. This is NOT optional, having any disturbance during your sleep will annihilate any effort you can undertake otherwise! An inexpensive silk black eye mask will do, and outer earplugs in silicon are advised as they are much more comfortable than inner earplugs (they reduce the proliferation of bacteria and hence itchy ears).</li>
<li>Mind the ultradian cycles (20 minutes "gates to sleep" every 1h30) and the dopaminergic forbidden zone of sleeping</li>
<li>If you can't sleep (eg, missed the ultradian cycle window), then wake up or sit and do something else than trying to sleep until the next window to sleep.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optional but strongly advised: take multivitamins and minerals, including B12 and magnesium supplementation every morning. B12 vitamin is known to potentiate the magnitude of the effect of light therapies. Supplements are not going to fix your circadian rhythm, but deficiencies can have a detrimental effect on it. Furthermore, deficiencies in other vitamins and minerals may impact mood (eg, magnesium), neurology (eg, vitamin B6) and the circadian rhythm (magnesium and B12), so by taking a multivitamins and minerals supplementation you eliminate these potential factors on your sleep easily. Plus, if you do a strict ketogenic diet, this supplementation will help avoid electrolytes imbalance (but you may also need to supplement in salt).</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Continue this combination of therapy strictly (respect the hours and use melatonin and light therapy everyday!) for at least 2 weeks. The first week you should see a reduction of your phase delay, and the next week your circadian rhythm (in particular your wake-up time) should be somewhat stable, and it will get more stable along time as you continue with the therapy. The time windows need to be respected, but a slight change of +-30min from day to day is OK in my experience (eg, taking melatonin 30min later or earlier, and there is more room for food timing as long as you do not eat past the melatonin intake time).
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer: I thorougly designed and tested this protocol on myself after several failed variations. I do not guarantee that this protocol will work for you, or that all steps are necessary, but I tried to test as many variations as I could by eliminating or changing some steps, and this is the only combination that worked so far, so keep that in mind if you partially try this protocol, if you skip some steps this may reduce the effectiveness (or not work at all). But even if you follow all steps, this may not work for you either. I share this protocol because it should be safe to try and because it was highly effective for me, so I believe it may work for other non24ers with the same etiology (genetic mutation of MT2 receptor?) as I have.

<h3>TROUBLESHOOTING</h3>

<p>
This section aims to answer several common and less common but crucial questions about circadian rhythm disorders and the potential treatments. The content aims to be a short version of the most crucial details I have accumulated in <a href="" title="my more complete 200+ document" class="page">my more complete 200+ document</a>, which you can read if you would like further information or details.
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of solutions usually: either change your environment, or wear gadgets to isolate from the environment. This guide focus on wearables, because although the results may be similar, wearables are much more comfortable and controllable, and hence more reliable than modifying the environment. Indeed, it's much easier to just put on your light therapy glasses and do your things such as preparing yourself for work, than standing in front of a light therapy lamp for 1-3h without doing anything else. You can even bring your light therapy glasses to work if you don't have enough time beforehand.
</p>

<p>
Also, wearables are a lot less expensive than older solutions. A proper light therapy setup used to cost thousands of dollars to get enough lux (most cheap lamps don't provide enough lux unless you are literally on the nose with the lamp). Nowadays, light therapy glasses cost only $100-200. For other things such as dark therapy, blue blocker glasses cost only $10. That's why for example we prefer an eye mask and ear plugs instead of using cardboard on the window and soundproofing the walls. We also prefer using blue blocker sunglasses and light therapy glasses such as Luminette instead of advising to buy bright light neon fixtures that you'll need to setup up all around your house at the correct orientation for you or to go outside for a walk early in the morning: it's far easier to just put some glasses on your nose when your alarm rings.
</p>

<h4>Sleep diary and diagnosis</h4>

<p>
Making a sleep log is the most useful thing someone with a sleep disorder can do. I strongly recommend to write a sleep log of when you fall asleep and when you wake up, for <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="at least 2 weeks" class="https">at least 2 weeks</a> but preferably longer. This sleep log will not only be helpful to you to better understand your sleep patterns, but also <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="can be used for diagnosis with a sleep specialist" class="https">can be used for diagnosis with a sleep specialist</a> and also is necessary to correctly time the only few treatment options that exist currently.
</p>

<p>
I strongly advise the app Sleepmeter Free on Android and its widget to write a digital sleep log which will produce nice charts that are easier for humans to read. It can also be installed on a computer using the Bluestacks emulator.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29991437/" title="actigraphy can be used for diagnosis" class="https">actigraphy can be used for diagnosis</a>, although this does not replace a sleep diary.

<p>
I f you find a good doctor who diagnose you and isn't on this list please send <a href="mailto:doctors@csd-n.org" title="them an email" class="mailto">them an email</a> to add your doctor in the list, this will help your future peers.
</p>

<p>
Also, if you find a properly trained doctor who successfully diagnose you, make sure to ask them to write down a description of your diagnosis, this will help later on to continue to get your treatment (eg, melatonin) if your doctor goes out of business and you need to find someone else, or to get work/school accomodations.

<h4>Why modify your circadian rhythm? Isn't free-running healthy enough?</h4>

<p>
The primary issue with having a circadian rhythm disorder is of course the huge chronic sleep deprivation that is constantly induced by the social jetlag (ie, the attempts to constraints to social expectations/requirements for work, family, hobbies, etc). Chronic sleep deprivation is a major health issue, not only for circadian rhythm disorders as most people are sleep deprived, although not to the extent that individuals with a circadian rhythm disorder experience. No need to go into details, you can find plenty of resources detailing how <a href="https://www.klova.com/blogs/the-daily-snooze/25-terrifying-side-effects-of-sleep-deprivation" title="harmful and dangerous sleep deprivation" class="https">harmful and dangerous sleep deprivation</a> is, one of the rare disorders that can directly cause death.
</p>

<p>
Note that being often ill may be a strong sign of chronic sleep deprivation.
</p>

<p>
Sleep deprivation can either be fixed by free-running or by being entrained, the latter being very difficult if not impossible to reach for most non24 at this stage of scientific knowledge. So is free-running enough to live heathily? Unfortunately, that's unlikely.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, free-running means that there is an almost constant <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="circadian misalignment" class="https">circadian misalignment</a> (ie, misalignment between the individual's circadian rhythm and the day/night cycle). But the production of some hormones, such as melatonin, is dependent on the external day/night cycle. Melatonin is produced most at night, as it is inhibited by bright light. Hence, a free-running individual is likely to have reduced levels of melatonin due to unwanted inhibition by light exposure.
</p>

<p>
What are the consequences of melatonin reduction? Well, melatonin is a strong (maybe the strongest) anti-oxydant in the body. It is also immunomodulatory. Hence, a lack of melatonin is linked in animal models with various diseases and immunodepression.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, mistimed eating when melatonin is at high levels in the body has been linked with metabolic dysregulations, and even directly caused diabetes in an animal model, without any other change of any other factor. Hence, both the lack of melatonin and the mistiming of melatonin with other factors such as food can produce detrimental effects on health, whether or not the individual is sleeping enough by free-running. (But of course these risks are far lower than what chronic sleep deprivation causes, so health-wise it's preferable to freerun rather than suffer from sleep deprivation, but it's also preferable to be entrained than to freerun, if of course an efficient treatment is possible for the individual).
</p>

<p>
Hence, supplementation of melatonin serves two purposes: to both supplement to overcome the lack of melatonin, and help with entrainment which directly reduces unwanted inhibition of melatonin by light.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, the potential health issues of free-running non-24 or DSPD sleeping according to their natural schedule remain unexplored by the medical science. But we do have indirect evidence from extrinsic circadian rhythm disorders, such as night shift disorder, which is much more common. We can define 3 different broad classes of health risks related to circadian rhythm disorders:<br>
<ul>
<li>Sleep deprivation, usually chronic (ie, regularly experienced)</li>
<li>Circadian misalignment</li>
<li>Hormonal suppression (including melatonin), by unwanted/uncontrolled light exposure.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>To nap or not to nap?</h4>

<p>
If you cannot afford to either follow an entrainment therapy, nor free-run, in other words if you need to constraint your sleep and suffer from sleep deprivation, the most healthy strategy seems to be to take long naps (ie, at least one ultradian cycle of 1h30-2h) when you need or can, since <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994417300172" title="long naps eliminate detrimental cardiovascular and neurologic health issues due to prior sleep deprivation, whereas short naps or no naps do not" class="https">long naps eliminate detrimental cardiovascular and neurologic health issues due to prior sleep deprivation, whereas short naps or no naps do not</a>.
</p>

<p>
Some studies argued that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5136610/" title="long naps may cause sleep inertia (the difficulty to wake up and lower cognitive performance for 10 min to a hour after) and hence short naps should be preferred" class="https">long naps may cause sleep inertia (the difficulty to wake up and lower cognitive performance for 10 min to a hour after) and hence short naps should be preferred</a>, but subsequent studies found that it's rather the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6710480/" title="prior sleep deprivation" class="https">prior sleep deprivation</a> that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30722039" title="exaggerates sleep inertia" class="https">exaggerates sleep inertia</a>, not the nap duration. Indeed, other studies have shown that <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2018/10/sleep-inertia-from-short-naps-linked-to-reduced-connectivity-between-brain-networks-52345" title="short naps can also produce sleep inertia, and furthermore sleep inertia is more frequent when the individual is awakened during a deep sleep stage" class="https">short naps can also produce sleep inertia, and furthermore sleep inertia is more frequent when the individual is awakened during a deep sleep stage</a> (stage 3 or slow wave sleep stage SWS), which can be reduced by using chronobiological alarm clocks (also called "smart alarm clock") such as Sleep As Android. This study also suggests more precisely that to avoid sleep inertia, the strategy should be to avoid waking up in the middle of deep sleep, which happens usually 25 to 30min after falling asleep, hence either shorter naps (less than 25 minutes) or full naps (one ultradian cycle of 1h30) should be preferred.
</p>

<h4>How to monitor my entrainment progress?</h4>

<p>
To see if your circadian rhythm is stabilizing to a constant time, it is possible to use your sleep diary. But do not monitor your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="bedtime nor your falling asleep time (sleep onset), as they are both unreliable markers of the circadian rhythm" class="https">bedtime nor your falling asleep time (sleep onset), as they are both unreliable markers of the circadian rhythm</a>. This was demonstrated on both typical sleepers and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27611743/" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a>. In other words, you can sleep more or less late with more or less variation while your circadian rhythm stays stabilized - the opposite is true, your bedtime can be regular but your circadian rhythm can still freeruns.
</p>

<p>
A much better measure is your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="wake up time (sleep offset), which is correlated with the DLMO and is hence a much better marker of the circadian rhythm" class="https">wake up time (sleep offset), which is correlated with the DLMO and is hence a much better marker of the circadian rhythm</a>. In other words, if your wake up time stays constant, this is a strong indication that you are stabilized.
</p>

<p>
But the wake up time can sometimes be variable due to the random occurrence of "weird insomnia" (likely <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1992.tb00019.x" title="biphasic sleep" class="https">biphasic sleep</a>) or external disturbances. An even better circadian rhythm marker is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="midpoint of the sleep period(s)" class="https">midpoint of the sleep period(s)</a>. This was also demonstrated in both typical sleepers and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27611743/" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a>.<br>
Let's say you usually sleep at 1.30am and wake up at 9.30am. The midpoint is the sleep onset time + average of (sleep onset/falling asleep - sleep offset/wake up) divided by 2 = 1.5+((9.5-1)/2) = 5.75 = 5.45am .<br>
Let's now say that the next night, you experience a biphasic sleep, so you sleep earlier at midnight but wake up at 5am and then sleep again between 9am and 11.30am. If we look only at the wake up time, it looks like you woke up 2h later than usual, but if we calculate the midpoint, we get: 0 + (11.5-0)/2 = 5.75 = 5.45am . This is exactly the same midpoint time as usual, so in fact even if the sleep was biphasic, the circadian rhythm did not change, and you will likely be able to sleep at the same time as usual on the next night.
</p>

<p>
In the future, it may become possible to more precisely monitor our circadian rhythm with the help of wearable core body temperature sensors.
</p>

<h4>Zeitgebers</h4>

<p>
Zeitgeber literally means "time giver". <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="A zeitgeber is any periodic signal of about 24h" class="https">A zeitgeber is any periodic signal of about 24h</a>, which the body can pick up and use to get entrained (ie, follow a 24h sleep-wake schedule).
</p>

<p>
Indeed, humans, and all biological systems, have no way to determine exactly the absolute time. Hence, we have biological, chemical and hormonal systems that approximate what can be called a biological clock. But since it's an approximation, it is imperfect: on average, humans follow a <a href="https://science.education.nih.gov/supplements/nih_sleep_curr-supp.pdf" title="24.2h schedule naturally according to the NIH" class="https">24.2h schedule naturally according to the NIH</a>. The remainder, 0.2h, serves as a margin of error, <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="which is eliminated thanks to external time cues: the zeitgebers" class="https">which is eliminated thanks to external time cues: the zeitgebers</a>. When this margin of error is correctly eliminated, we say that the individual is entrained on a 24h schedule.
</p>

<p>
Hence, zeitgebers are the essential tool we have to modify the circadian rhythm of humans, and hence potentially treat circadian rhythm disorders. When something modify the circadian rhythm, it is a zeitgeber.
</p>

<p>
Humans are biological predetermined to respond more or less intensely to some zeitgebers, which includes the influence on their circadian rhythms. According to the current scientific literature, here is a rough outline of the order of power of zeitgebers on the circadian rhythm:
</p>

<p>
Light (strongest) &gt; melatonin (strong) ~ food (likely strong) &gt;&gt; exercise (weak) ~ social interactions (weak)
</p>

<p>
Light is the strongest zeitgeber by far. Indeed, we have specific photoreceptors, the ipRGC cells, in the eyes which are tailored to react to light to both dilate or contract the pupils and to shift the circadian rhythm. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30700675/" title="Light is undoubtedly the most potent zeitgeber" class="https">Light is undoubtedly the most potent zeitgeber</a>, and hence therapeutic tool for circadian rhythm disorders.
</p>

<p>
Melatonin comes second, as its purpose is to both consolidate sleep (ie, ensure you don't wake up in the second half of your night so you can sleep a full night), and phase advance.
</p>

<p>
Food is still under research but since the digestive tract produces most melatonin in the body, 2 orders of magnitude more than the brain, food is also arguably a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="very strong zeitgeber" class="https">very strong zeitgeber</a>. Also, since we have multiple clocks throughout the body and down to every cells, we likely need to entrain them all. The LiDACMel protocol attempts to do that with a combination of light/dark  therapy, melatonin and food (composition and timing) control.
</p>

<p>
Other potential zeitgebers such as <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6472" title="exercise or social interactions are weak zeitgebers" class="https">exercise or social interactions are weak zeitgebers</a>, and often not timed appropriately (eg, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/55022-when-is-the-best-time-to-exercise-to-improve-performance" title="exercise is more in phase with the circadian rhythm when done in the evening than the morning" class="https">exercise is more in phase with the circadian rhythm when done in the evening than the morning</a>).
</p>

<p>
Every zeitgeber can be good (phase advance) or bad (phase delay) depending on the timing. This time-dependent effect, which is on top of the dose-dependent effect (eg, intensity of light or dosage of melatonin), is summarized in the Phase Response Curve (PRC) of the target treatment.
</p>

<p>
Zeitgebers are double-edged swords: since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="PRC is an intrinsic and universal property of all zeitgebers" class="https">PRC is an intrinsic and universal property of all zeitgebers</a>, present <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/johnsonlab/prcatlas/" title="in all animals" class="https">in all animals</a> and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7232967" title="unicellular organisms" class="https">unicellular organisms</a>, this means that when a factor can phase delay, it can also phase advance if exposure happens at another time. For example, if you suspect getting exposed to screens light in the evening phase delays your circadian rhythm, then the same screens light can be used at wake-up to phase advance.
</p>

<p>
The exact appropriate timing for phase advance or phase delaying depends on the treatment, it's not necessarily at wake up for phase advance or at evening for phase delay (eg, for melatonin the PRC is inversed with the light PRC).
</p>

<p>
Here are the simplified PRC curves for light and melatonin effect on humans (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PRC-Light%2BMel.png" title="image" class="https">image</a> from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_response_curve" title="Wikipedia" class="https">Wikipedia</a>):
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/PRC-Light-and-Mel.png">
</p>

<p>
There are in theory <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-3-540-29678-2_6170" title="two types of zeitgebers" class="https">two types of zeitgebers</a>: the type-0 resetters, which theoretically can reset at the time you target regardless of your current circadian rhythm, versus type-1 resetters, which effect is dependent on the intake/exposure time relatively to your current circadian rhythm. In practice, all zeitgebers (and hence treatments) are type-1 resetters. Hence, <b>it's crucial to time all treatments relatively to your current sleep and wake up times, not the target/wished ones</b>. This is true not only for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="melatonin" class="https">melatonin</a> (see also <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="here" class="https">here</a>), but also light therapy and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="food" class="https">food</a>. It's not specific to treatments for circadian rhythm disorders, in fact there is an emerging field of scientific and medical study which is finding that virtually all drugs have a time-dependent effect relative to the circadian rhythm, such as antibiotics, so in fact all drugs are most efficient when taken relatively to the circadian rhythm. This time-dependent effect of zeitgebers is also what makes <a href="https://srbr.org/of-larks-and-owls-whats-in-a-chronotype/" title="research about them difficult, as it is easy for scientists, working at usual office hours, to miss time-dependent effects" class="https">research about them difficult, as it is easy for scientists, working at usual office hours, to miss time-dependent effects</a>.
</p>

<p>
Is it necessary to use multiple zeitgebers, even if we only have a slightly bigger circadian rhythm than the average, let's say 24.5h? Yes, because not only having multiple zeitgebers allows to have a failsafe in case you miss one of the zeitgebers (eg, forget to take the melatonin pill one day, then at least the light therapy will still help), and also because the body has multiple circadian clocks: the most famous one is the brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the pineal gland, but there is also lots of peripheral clocks down to every cells. If a zeitgeber entrains one but not the others (such light not entraining the digestive clock), then the body may still continue to freerun because of the mismatch between the various body clocks and hence prevent whole body entrainment.
</p>

<h4>Melatonin</h4>

<p>
Although it is now known that melatonin is most effective several hours (3-6h) before usual bedtime, contrary to previous medical misconceptions (which often prescribed melatonin 1h before target bedtime), due to inter-individual variability in DLMO and sensitivity to melatonin, there is no way to tell exactly what time and dosage will be ideal for anybody. This means that the best and only way to find the optimal timing and dosage of melatonin for you is by <b>trial-and-error</b>.
</p>

<p>
It's impossible that melatonin doesn't affect you. It's processed by every single cells in your body, and it's a necessary hormone with lots of biological functions apart from circadian rhythm stabilization, without it you would likely be dead.
</p>

<p>
If melatonin does not seem to work for you, there are 3 possible reasons i see for melatonin pills to be ineffective in your case:
</p>

<p>
1- Incorrect formulation: instant release form works better than prolonged release for circadian rhythm disorders. If unsure, just crush the pills into a powder, this will make it into an instant release form in any case because it's only the coating that can make melatonin into a prolonged release form.
</p>

<p>
2- Wrong timing: intake should be 2-6h before your natural sleep onset, not your target one.
</p>

<p>
3- Bright light exposure after taking melatonin will inhibit melatonin. Even a computer screen at medium or full brightness can inhibit melatonin (because the effect is stronger when you stare at the light source).
</p>

<p>
4- <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263069/" title="High variability in the quality control of over-the-counter melatonin pills, sometimes with a dosage 5x higher or smaller than what is labelled on the package" class="https">High variability in the quality control of over-the-counter melatonin pills, sometimes with a dosage 5x higher or smaller than what is labelled on the package</a>, even for the same brand and product but between lots. This variability may be the root cause for why some people report too much effect, while others report no effect at all for the same dosage. It may simply be that under the hood they didn't have the same dosage at all. If you experienced too much effect with melatonin, at least this is a good hint this works, so you may try another brand with the same or different dosage to adjust and maybe find a brand with a good enough quality control, or ask a pharmacy to make a preparation in a lab for you. Personally, after trying lots of melatonin formulations including from pharmacies and labs, I found the Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin works well and stably, but I can't guarantee the stability nor purity. Also, a tip as the authors note: "the <b>least variable products were those that contained the simplest mix of ingredients, generally oral or sublingual tablets with melatonin</b> added to a filler of silica or cellulose derivatives and were the most reproducible", which is the case of <a href="http://valdispert.com/products/melatonin/melatonin19/" title="Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin" class="http">Valdispert 1.9mg instant release melatonin</a>, where melatonin is the sole active component (no camomille or other "sleeping inducing natural herbs" stuff).
</p>

<p>
5- Optionally: Reduce/avoid food and sweet drinks after taking melatonin. Some people have a genetic mutation of the melatonin type 2 (MT2) receptor that does weird things when both glucose and melatonin are present in the blood stream.
</p>

<p>
Fwiw, for 10 years i was like that, i thought melatonin had no effect on me, until i recently learned how to use it. It's a quite delicate thing, it only works under specific circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Is melatonin safe for kids? It was used in multiple trials for autistic children, including <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30132686/" title="a long-term one" class="https">a long-term one</a>, and is even commercially available as a medically regulated drug under the name of Circadin or PedPRM, so yes it is safe. Also, there is no known letal dose, since humans could ingest orally up to 100mg with no issue. The <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="AASM guidelines" class="https">AASM guidelines</a> issued a WEAK FOR in favor of melatonin treatment for children with DSPD.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31722088/" title="Melatonin has very few side effects and no serious (dangerous) ones" class="https">Melatonin has very few side effects and no serious (dangerous) ones</a>. Both the <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/NUT2016SA0209.pdf" title="EFSA (european commission for food safety) and the ANSES (french commission for drugs safety)" class="https">EFSA (european commission for food safety) and the ANSES (french commission for drugs safety)</a> considered melatonin effective for circadian rhythm adjustements if one day dose contains at least 0.5mg and generally safe <a href="https://www.revmed.ch/RMS/2018/RMS-N-604/Alerte-francaise-sur-les-risques-de-la-melatonine-en-vente-libre" title="except for individuals with neurological comorbidities and pregnant women" class="https">except for individuals with neurological comorbidities and pregnant women</a>. But the one that is common and that is the core of most complaints is that melatonin can produce more vivid dreams. More vivid dreams are not necessarily nightmares, but they often are. Hence, melatonin increases the likelihood of experiencing nightmares. Are nightmares bad for the circadian rhythm or sleep? According to a study (the only one on this question, there is surprisingly very few scientists who investigated this question), <a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-014-0023-4" title="nightmares affect subjective feelings of sleep quality but not sleep quality per se" class="https">nightmares affect subjective feelings of sleep quality but not sleep quality per se</a>, as there is no objective change in the sleep structure whether or not the dream is good or bad. This finding can also be put into perspective with the slightly more extensive research about lucid dreams, which shows that being conscious during dreams does not impact the sleep structure or quality either. So this indicates that the <b>dreams content is irrelevant to the sleep structure or quality</b>. This matches what I observed experimentally, that nightmares do not impact the circadian rhythm nor mood nor energy levels during wakefulness periods, it's rather the sleep duration and timing (relative to the circadian rhythm) that matters.

<p>

</p>

<p>
The two most efficient strategies seem to involve wearing earplugs (to reduce auditory noise) and an eye mask (to reduce unwanted light exposure).

</p>

<p>
Although an earmask and an earplugs can't directly entrain your circadian rhythm, they are essential to avoid disturbances from messing with your sleep and hence your entrainment. Indeed, <b>as a rule of thumb: you can't stay entrained if you are sleep deprived</b>.
</p>

<p>
What eye mask to choose? A silk black eye mask is inexpensive ($10) and very comfortable, use that in most cases. For those who have no curtains whatsoever or who are super sensitive to light and don't mind being less comfortable (or if you are on a road trip for example and you have no way but to be directly exposed to sunlight in the morning), the 3D black eye masks can be better suited, as they are rigid and hence completely opaque, but they are less comfortable and also a bit more expensive (but still very affordable, like $40).
</p>

<p>
Here is a simple silk eye mask:<br>

</p>

<p>
Do NOT put cardboard or black plastic behind your window to curtain it, because this will accumulate temperature in the window's glass and ultimately break it! Prefer to use an eye mask or if you really want to curtain your window, you can try a light reflector / windscreen shade reflector, but be warned I did not test this and this may also break your window: <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE" title="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE" class="https">https://www.amazon.co.uk/SILVER-FOLDING-WINDSCREEN-SHADE-REFLECTOR/dp/B004VMORXE</a>
</p>

<p>
What type of ear plugs to choose? There are essentially two types of ear plugs: inner ear plugs and outer ear plugs. The issue with ear plugs is that they need to be comfortable enough to stay the whole duration of your sleep. In my experience, it seems most of the time when an ear plug falls, it's because I unconsciously removed it because of itchy ears.
</p>

<p>
How to avoid itchy ears with ear plugs? Inner ear plugs block the inside of the ear canal and this often causes a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1866818" title="proliferation of bacteria or fungus, which likely produces itchy ears" class="https">proliferation of bacteria or fungus, which likely produces itchy ears</a>. If you don't want itchy ears, then the only way is to avoid that is not put anything in the inner ear. Luckily, that's exactly the purpose of outer earplugs. They are more difficult to handle so you have to learn how to use them, and they reduce a bit less the noise, but they are much more comfortable for sleeping. Plus, if they are in silicon, they are washable with soap and water, so they are reusable for about a week. Just make sure to NOT put the outer ear plugs inside your ears, always keep them mostly on the outside. Examples of outer ear plugs in silicon that I tested: Mack's silicon ear plugs or Medigrade silicon ear plugs.
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/silicon-outer-earplugs.jpg" width="400">
</p>

<p>
Also, if you use outer earplugs, don't worry about accidental events: they don't mask alarms or very loud noises, they just tone down, so you will hear your alarm clock in the morning and hear the siren if there is a fire, it's just so toned down that you can choose to ignore it and go back to sleep if you want to. So the sound is less filtered than with a typical inner ear plug, but the advantage is that they do not get itchy and it's highly comfortable to sleep with outer earplugs compared to inner earplugs.
</p>

<h4>Light therapy and Luminette</h4>

<p>
Light is without a doubt the most powerful tool we have to manipulate the circadian rhythm. Hence, <b>light is the number 1 tool anyone with a (sighted) circadian rhythm disorder needs to try</b>. All other currently available treatments (including melatonin) provide much less circadian shifts than light can (but they can be combined for greater effect).
</p>

<p>
Luminettes aren't really necessary, anything that stimulate your nasal hemiretina should work, but Luminette are more effective, because it is enriched in blue light and has a comfortable form factor (glasses) which guarantee an adequate and invariable distance and angle of the LEDs to adequately stimulate the ipRGC cells.
</p>

<p>
Blue light stimulates the eyes' ipRGCs receptors more, those that impact the circadian rhythm, but <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6926481/" title="amber light was also shown to affect the circadian rhythm" class="https">amber light was also shown to affect the circadian rhythm</a> (see also <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449476/" title="here" class="https">here</a>) since the body can also use variations in the light's color as a zeitgeber, in addition (or replacement) to light intensity (eg, to continue to be entrained under cloudy sunlight, by detecting if it's blue - daytime - or amber/dark - night time).
</p>

<p>
However, although all light colors can shift the circadian rhythm and hence help with entrainment, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12727312/" title="blue light alone is about 185 times more efficient than polychromatic white light" class="https">blue light alone is about 185 times more efficient than polychromatic white light</a>. For stable entrainment, the goal is to oppose the natural daily phase delay of an individual's non-24 circadian rhythm with an equal or greater amount of phase advance, such as by using bright light therapy. Hence, we want to maximize the phase advance to set all chances on our side. To maximize, the goal is to stimulate the ipRGC receptors in the eyes the most, hence there are 2 parameters with subparameters:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>Maximizing ipRGC cells stimulation:</li>

</div>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>light exposure timing relatively to the individual's circadian rhythm (ie, the Phase-Response Curve - PRC). This manifests as two practical effects:</li>
</ol>
<div style='padding-left: 30pt'>
a- light exposure in one's biological morning phase advances the most.<br>
b- a longer duration of exposure leads to a proportionally bigger phase advance: a study shown that using a relatively low light intensity of 500 lux but over <a href="" title="6.5h produced a 3h phase advance, whereas 1h of the same light therapy only produced a 1.15h phase advance" class="page">6.5h produced a 3h phase advance, whereas 1h of the same light therapy only produced a 1.15h phase advance</a>.
</div>
</p>

<p>
Is more light always better? Not necessarily, because there is a physiological limit beyond which light intensity doesn't matter because we already reached ipRGC cells max stimulation. This maximum stimulation limit was quantified <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892948/" title="and is limited to 2 orders of magnitude" class="https">and is limited to 2 orders of magnitude</a> (eg, 100-10000 lux). Since blue light is about 185 times more efficient to stimulate ipRGC cells, it's much easier with blue light to reach the max stimulation of ipRGC cells and hence maximize the phase advance than with white light or other colors. That's why most blue light therapy glasses only use a low lux setting such as 500 lux or max 1500 lux, whereas white light therapy lamps use 10000 lux (the reduction in lux also serves as battery saving strategy since 10K lux is too much to run on a battery).
</p>

<p>
The effect of light on the circadian rhythm is not solely due to its inhibition of melatonin, because it was shown that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="intermittent light can phase advance the circadian rhythm without reducing melatonin production, and that a longer light exposure causes more phase advance irrespective of any effect on melatonin" class="https">intermittent light can phase advance the circadian rhythm without reducing melatonin production, and that a longer light exposure causes more phase advance irrespective of any effect on melatonin</a>. Hence, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="melatonin is decoupled from the circadian rhythm" class="https">melatonin is decoupled from the circadian rhythm</a> as shown by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983144/" title="several" class="https">several</a> <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="studies" class="https">studies</a>.
</p>

<p>
Although the phase advance effect of light and melatonin is limited, they <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/95/7/3325/2596406" title="are additive" class="https">are additive</a>, so that you can for example get 1h phase advance from melatonin and separately 1h from light therapy, and combining both would give you 2h in theory (in practice it will be less because there is some natural biological variability from day-to-day, but at least by combining multiple therapies you get more leeway to stay entrained despite uncontrollable disturbances).
</p>

<p>
So it is possible to try to use only light therapy alone, it was shown in lots of studies and in systematic reviews to work without needing melatonin, but of course you will get less effect. Expect about 1-2h of phase advance with each treatment alone (see <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27449476/" title="here" class="https">here</a> for light), and combined the effect is additive (melatonin + light therapy can help you to achieve 2-4h in total).
</p>

<p>
Luminette can be put on top of prescription glasses (personally tested with huge aviator-style glasses), and they use a battery that lasts for 5 days with 1 to 2 uses per day (= 1 to 2h with the 500 lux light intensity setting). Re-timer are also made to fit over prescription glasses (but did not test myself).
</p>

<p>
If you want a cheaper alternative, there are the Re-Timer glasses, which I did not try. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41105-018-0167-5" title="Re-timer 's green light is sufficient to phase advance" class="https">Re-timer 's green light is sufficient to phase advance</a>, but since it's using green light it doesn't increase vigilance so it doesn't change the feeling of subjective sleepiness in the morning. Using green light, which is a weird choice because <a href="https://www.psio.com/fr/recherche-lumiere-verte.html" title="green light is more efficient at pain reduction" class="https">green light is more efficient at pain reduction</a> and about 75% less at shifting the circadian rhythm compared to blue light, whereas blue light is optimal for vigilance and circadian rhythm shifting. Currently, only Luminette and Psio make light therapy glasses with completely blue light and hence are the most effective light therapy glasses on the consumer market currently. Also both have several independent studies demonstrating significant phase advance (see their respective websites or google scholar), whereas Re-timer only has one as of 2020.
</p>

<p>
Can the light therapy glasses work even with eyes closed? Yes:
</p>

<p>
&gt; The eyelid acts as a red-pass filter (Zeitzer et al. 2014) and transmits only approximately 3%–14% of light (Robinson et al. 1991) in a wavelength-dependent manner. Thus, the retinal exposure of light depends on the status of the eyes (open, closed).<br>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" class="https">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830</a>
</p>

<p>
So yes it works, and even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="with light as low as 5-10 lux while the eyes are closed" class="https">with light as low as 5-10 lux while the eyes are closed</a>, but much less. What i do is that i first use the Luminette for a few minutes with the eyes closed so my eyes have some time to adjust, and then i open. It's good to adjust the eyes so you don't get side effects of sudden bright light. But then it's better to open the eyes as soon as possible to get the full circadian shifting effect. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28656675/" title="There is a link between pupil adjustment to light/darkness and circadian rhythm shifting" class="https">There is a link between pupil adjustment to light/darkness and circadian rhythm shifting</a>, because both are mostly modulated by the ipRGCs (in case of the effect of light on the circadian rhythm, but other things can impact the circadian rhythm such as food). So basically if your pupil is  contracted, you're likely doing the dark therapy good enough. If your pupil is dilated (so you can't see in darkness), then you're doing bright light therapy good.
</p>

<p>
Is light therapy dangerous for the eyes, more precisely the macula? According to European Union, <a href="https://www.anses.fr/fr/system/files/AP2014SA0253Ra.pdf" title="ANSES" class="https">ANSES</a> and FDA regulations, and also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="systematic reviews by scholars" class="https">systematic reviews by scholars</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="here" class="https">here</a>), if the device is filtering UV light and the intensity is not too much, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28891192" title="the user does not have a macular disease" class="https">the user does not have a macular disease</a>, then it is fine. I cannot cover all devices, but Luminette is validated under the all those regulations.
</p>

<p>
However, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-26635-7" title="a recent study found that light therapy devices (more precisely the Re-Timer) modified significantly the macula under 7 days of usage" class="https">a recent study found that light therapy devices (more precisely the Re-Timer) modified significantly the macula under 7 days of usage</a>, with only 30 min of bright light exposure per day at wake up. However, the experiment design needs to be considered: the participants were maintained in a room constantly under 10 Lux, which is very low (1 lux = light emitted by 1 candle). Hence, this study did not just test the effect of bright light therapy, but more precisely the effect of <b>sudden</b> bright light therapy in a constantly dim environment. This forced the participants to have dilated pupils, which is known to multiply the effects of light. Hence, there needs to be more research to elucidate whether 1- the significant changes that were found are clinically significant (ie, can they lead to diseases or they are just natural body adaptations that are not indicative of any disease), and 2- whether these observed effects are due to pupil dilation, in other words if the user takes some time to adapt their eyes beforehand (eg, by closing the eyes the first few minutes while under the bright light, to let their pupils contract) these effects would disappear.
</p>

<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/luminette-v3-2.jpg" width="400">
</p>

<p>
If for some reason you had to discontinue using light therapy for some time, let's say 30 min, can you resume after or should you stop? You can continue, this should have little impact on the light therapy. Indeed, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29707782/" title="intermittent light therapy was shown to be as effective" class="https">intermittent light therapy was shown to be as effective</a> (if not <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5983136/" title="more" class="https">more</a>) than continuous light therapy, although less efficient at inhibiting melatonin. Hence, if you stop for some minutes and resume light therapy after, you can expect to still get the same phase advance, however the effect on vigilance may be reduced, particularly if you experience drowsiness due to melatonin leftovers.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, there is room for future discoveries on light therapy and circadian rhythm shifting, as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15039146" title="studies on mice identified at least 6 different subtypes of ipRGC cells" class="https">studies on mice identified at least 6 different subtypes of ipRGC cells</a>. Whether the subtypes have different functions and stimulation thresholds and conditions remain to be explored.
</p>

<h4>A cheaper alternative for light therapy</h4>

<p>
If you really are low on money and can't afford the light therapy glasses, I do not advise to buy a light therapy lamp. Sure, there are inexpensive ones available, but there are three major downsides:
</p>

<p>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>the cheapest light therapy lamps are not very powerful, they say they emit 10K lux but it's only at point-blank with no range, and with lux approximately decreasing quadratically with the distance, it means that if you are just a few centimeters away from the ideal distance, you will get very low lux (low light intensity).</li>
<li>they are cumbersome to use, you need to stay in front of them for minimum 30 minutes up to several hours, and it's hard to do anything in front given how close you need to stay to the lamp and the angle you need for your eyes to get properly exposed.</li>
<li>the major drawback I think is that it's only one lamp, whereas both of our eyes have ipRGC cells (the photoreceptive cells that shift the circadian rhythm depending on their exposure to light). The more ipRGC cells that are stimulated, the bigger circadian shift that happens. Unfortunately, with only one lamp, if it's set on the side of your peripheral vision, it will only stimulate one eye's ipRGC cells (since they are located in the macula and the nasal part of the retina). Ideally, you would need <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="2 such lamps and adequately placed" class="https">2 such lamps and adequately placed</a>, but at this point light therapy glasses are as much expensive and much more comfortable to use and they stimulate both eyes cells.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/pasted_image002.png" width="300"><br>
<i>Ideal placement of 2 light therapy lamps, on the sides of both eyes so that the light can reach the nasal region of both eyes' retinas. Image from </i><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194647/" title="this study" class="https">this study</a><i>.</i>
</p>

<p>
An inexpensive and potentially more effective strategy is to use computer screens at their maximal intensity directly at wake-up for 30min to 2h. Not only the distance to the user is similar to a light therapy device (contrary to TV screens which may be too far to get enough lux), but also the user can stare directly at the screen, which light will stimulate the ipRGC cells in the macula of both eyes. Then, the rest of the day, the user can get exposed to natural sunlight to increase the duration of light exposure without any device. In the evening, the screens must be dimmed and blue light filtered to avoid the circadian phase delay effect opposing the circadian phase advance obtained in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Note however that screens may not be sufficient in winter, due to the reduced intensity of natural sunlight, so light therapy glasses are certainly more reliable.
</p>

<h4>Dark therapy and blue blocker glasses</h4>

<p>
Dark therapy is the avoidance of light exposure, usually in the evening. Why is this necessary and how important is it? As explained in the Zeitgeber section above, zeitgebers are double-edged swords, anything that can phase advance your circadian rhythm can also phase delay it. Since light therapy is the strongest zeitgeber and hence most helpful treatment, it can also be the most detrimental factor if your eyes are exposed in the evening to light.
</p>

<p>
Of critical importance, it was demonstrated that the human body has a <a href="https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.201194" title="photic history" class="https">photic history</a>, which means that <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-079X.2002.01885.x" title="light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night" class="https">light therapy in the morning is less effective if an individual is exposed to light in the previous evening or night</a> (and this reduced effect can be sustained for days after the light exposure at night!). This is another reason why dark therapy is always necessary if light therapy is to be done properly, because dark therapy directly increases the efficacy of light therapy.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it was shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27091519" title="people have different sensitivities to light" class="https">people have different sensitivities to light</a>, with some being <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31138694/" title="hypersensitive to light" class="https">hypersensitive to light</a>, which holds even more true for individuals with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542884" title="DSPD" class="https">DSPD</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30281150" title="here" class="https">here</a>) or <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e24/1cade46b0c7ed28753dbb1685c7e8bfde204.pdf" title="non24" class="https">non24</a> (see also <a href="https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/19156?locale-attribute=fr" title="here" class="https">here</a>), which can compound with the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21188265/" title="mistimed intrinsic circadian rhythm with the day-night cycle which makes these individuals more prone to the sensitive parts of the PRC" class="https">mistimed intrinsic circadian rhythm with the day-night cycle which makes these individuals more prone to the sensitive parts of the PRC</a> (ie, the timing when light has more shifting effect on the circadian rhythm).

</p>

<p>
Of importance, the sensitivity bandwidth of the eyes is not the same for visual signals and non-visual signals (ie, circadian rhythm shift): <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3892948/" title="9 to 10 orders of magnitude for visual, whereas it's limited to 2 orders of magnitude for non-visual" class="https">9 to 10 orders of magnitude for visual, whereas it's limited to 2 orders of magnitude for non-visual</a>. Combined with the fact that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30311830" title="circadian rhythm shift and melatonin suppression are achieved with light with an intensity as low as 5-10 lux" class="https">circadian rhythm shift and melatonin suppression are achieved with light with an intensity as low as 5-10 lux</a> (and maybe even <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30697806/" title="lower" class="https">lower</a>), this means that humans are sensitive to light of virtually any intensity and color, and the maximum phase shift is reached with max 1,000 to 10,000 lux, so no need to burn your eyes with more intense lights. On the other hand, this also means that any effort to further reduce light exposure in the evening is worth it.
</p>

<p>
To do that, it's possible to install f.lux or another blue light filter app. They are indeed effective, but not enough, as it's also necessary to dim the screen brightness to the minimum. Indeed, both light intensity and color matters, it's not enough to just filter blue light, or to dim down the light intensity, it's necessary to do both.
</p>

<p>
As indicated by <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11818-019-00215-x" title="this review" class="https">this review</a>:
</p>

<p>
&gt; Smartphone use may delay sleep onset. One factor is the light emitted by their screens, but another may also be its entertaining character or related psychological effects, or both. Using the <b>“night shift” mode</b> of modern smartphones, the colour balance of the screen can be shifted to “warmer” and <b>orangeish colours</b> depleted in short-wavelength light. On a recent iPhone 7, this <b>amounts to a reduction of melanopsin activation by 67%</b> at full display brightness. This might seem like a large reduction at first, though <b>by simply dimming the smartphone to its minimum level,</b> <b>the melanopsin activation can be reduced to less than 1% of the activation at maximum display brightness</b>.
</p>

<p>
And this quote is for smartphones, which have a much lower minimal brightness than computer screens because they need to save power for extended battery duration, and so they try to save on hardware backlight power. In my experience, using a smartphone with the Twilight app for blue filtering and dimming light to the max on the phone and a bit more in the app allows to use the smartphone with little impact on the circadian rhythm or feelings of tiredness. Configured like that, a smartphone is probable safer to use for reading than a book, because the bed lamp you need to light your book can also shift your circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
On computers, unfortunately most computer screens do not dim much the backlight (they rather use a variable flickering scheme - called Pulse-Width Modulation - which is worse because it becomes an intermittent bright light device), so it's preferable to rather use a smartphone or wear blue blocker sunglasses. Hence, there is not much you can do to reduce further your screen intensity. Some apps such as Dimmer will add a transparent black window that will mimic a brightness reduction, but it won't actually reduce the backlighting and hence no meaningful reduction of lux is achieved. If you plan on buying a new computer, you can check whether it uses PWM by reading <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Why-Pulse-Width-Modulation-PWM-is-such-a-headache.270240.0.html" title="notebookcheck reviews" class="https">notebookcheck reviews</a>.
</p>

<p>
A very convenient alternative, instead of installing all these softwares and modifying all your environment's light lamps, is to wear <b>blue blocker SUNglasses</b>.
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker glasses are just a wearable device that allows to do dark therapy while being independent from environmental conditions. Blue blocker glasses are amber/orange glasses filtering blue and green light, without dimming the light. You can use them when you are out at a friend's house for example, or if someone is at your house for a dinner or something, you can still do your dark therapy while keeping the lights on for your guests, or simply to read a book without changing your light (else you need to use a red light bulb, which is inexpensive but makes it hard to read).
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker SUNglasses are just like blue blocker glasses, but in addition they have a transparent black shading layer to dim down light. Hence, they both filter blue light and dim any light source (which includes devices where you can't install a blue filtering app, such as alarm clocks, TV screens, etc).
</p>

<p>
Blue blocker glasses should be used <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="2-3h before habitual bedtime" class="https">2-3h before habitual bedtime</a> to allow for endogenous melatonin to build up.
</p>

<p>
Here is a DIY blue blocker sunglasses made out of a UVEX Skyper blue blocker glasses, with added 5% black shading/tinting filters for cars windows (one filter outside and one filter outside = 2 in total, 5% means that 95% of light is filtered), simply taped onto the frame:<br>

</p>

<p>
And here is what it looks like to look through a blue blocker SUNglasses (so it's also dimming down the light - in practice it can dim down sunlight so much that it looks like it's night, which is perfect):
</p>

<p>
Without:<br>

</p>

<p>
With the blue blocker SUNglasses (same ISO and photo parameters as the picture above - note how we can see the shape of the neon tube, just as if it was itself less intense, which also shows that obviously you should NOT drive when using the blue blocker SUNglasses):<br>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/uvex-blue-blocker-sunglasses-simulation-2.jpg" width="500">
</p>

<p>
Word of caution: not all blue blocker glasses are alike. Most are made for "comfort", to filter the blue light from screens and "reduce eye fatigue". But not from sunlight, which is very different and hence these will be insufficient for any other purpose than filtering screens light (ie, maybe not even sufficient to filter room lamps). Comfort blue blockers are very different from industrial-grade blue blocker glasses, the latter being made (and advertised) to protect from <b>light hazards</b> that can damage the eyes of industrial workers. So if you see blue blocker glasses being advertised as comfort devices, with photos of people in front of their screens, then likely they are not efficiently filtering all of blue and green light. If the glasses are tinted yellow, they are of very low quality, don't choose that, prefer orange/amber glasses. On the opposite, if the glasses are presented as safety wear for industrial workers, they are likely much more filtering.
</p>

<p>
Are "comfort" blue blocker glasses or coating for prescription glasses sufficient? They are at least better than nothing for sure, but more filtering means you will be better protected from environmental light exposure in the evening.
</p>

<p>
If possible, it is strongly advised to choose blue blocker glasses that provably filters the whole spectrum of blue and green light. To prove the filtering efficiency, it's simple: use a spectrometer behind the glasses under the sunlight. However, spectrometers are quite expensive. But fortunately there are a few tests you can refer to, such as the Blubox review, which shows that both <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/spectrum-test-results-for-leading-blue-light-glasses-brands-revealed" title="UVEX (cheap industrial safety props maker) and Blublox (more expensive but filters a bit more) filter most of the blue and green light bands" class="https">UVEX (cheap industrial safety props maker) and Blublox (more expensive but filters a bit more) filter most of the blue and green light bands</a>. There is also this <a href="https://www.jasonlauritzen.com/blue-blockers-compared-and-how-to-make-your-own/" title="other spectrometer review with more brands (and it's also a tutorial on how to make your own DIY blue blocker glasses)" class="https">other spectrometer review with more brands (and it's also a tutorial on how to make your own DIY blue blocker glasses)</a>. Indeed, an <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/youre-wearing-the-wrong-blue-light-glasses" title="adequate blue blocker glasses must also blocking green light" class="https">adequate blue blocker glasses must also blocking green light</a> (here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/h11xok/followup_from_cured_sufferer/" title="testimony" class="https">testimony</a>). Another thing to consider is how much the blue blocker glasses are covering your eyes: if they don't cover adequately, light coming from the sides can still reach your eyes, and actually most of the ipRGC cells (the ones that shift your circadian rhythm) are located in the nasal region, so light coming from the sides of the eyes are very effective at shifting your circadian rhythm.
</p>

<p>
If you have prescription glasses, you can choose the Uvex S0360X Ultra spec SCT Orange, which very comfortably fit on top of any prescription glasses (tested with large aviator-style prescription glasses) and still covers from all directions of light. The Uvex S0360X Ultra spec SCT Orange uses exactly the same material and hence has the same blue and green light filtering efficiency as the <a href="https://www.blublox.com/blogs/news/spectrum-test-results-for-leading-blue-light-glasses-brands-revealed" title="Uvex Skyper tested here" class="https">Uvex Skyper tested here</a>. Here is a photo:
</p>

<p>
<img src="./SleepNon24VLiDACMel_files/Uvex-S0360X-Ultra-spec-SCT-Orange.jpg" width="400"><br>
Just like the Skyper, this one can be adapted to SUNglasses by adding shading films.
</p>

<p>
In practice, I use 2 pairs of UVEX blue blocker glasses:<br>
<ul>
<li>one with shading film that I use to dim down uncontrollable light sources when there is sunlight or at the office when I work late to dim down the bright neon lights,</li>
<li>and another one without a shading film (so just the blue blocker glasses as-is) that I use in the evening at home to simply filter the blue and green lights.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Since there is currently no commercially available blue blocker sunglasses to my knowledge, you will need to do it yourself. If you wear prescription glasses, an easier solution might be to buy a clip-on shading lenses, that you clip on your prescription glasses, and then fit the UVEX S0360X on top. This should both filter blue and green lights, as well as dim down all light sources. It may also be possible to use the clip-on on the UVEX glasses themselves (but I did not try). However, the clip-on may not be dimming as well as the DIY solution.
</p>

<p>
A great tip I am still experimenting with but may be very useful: if you're doing dark therapy right, your eyes should be dilated just like as if you were in the dark. This is because it's the same photoreceptive cells in the eye (the ipRGC cells) that are both modulating the pupil's dilation and circadian rhythm shifting in response to light exposure. So remember the test: check if your pupils are dilated. If you can see in the dark while using a device or doing an activity, it's ok for dark therapy and hence can be used during the 3h before bedtime.
</p>

<p>
(Side-note: although the idea to make the blue blocker glasses into sunglasses is my own, a previous blog post independently communicated a similar idea, to make "<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/long-fuse-big-bang/201701/cheap-new-wonder-drug" title="amber tinted shaded glasses" class="https">amber tinted shaded glasses</a>" to treat circadian rhythm disorders)

<h4>Food timing and diet composition (carbs or keto?)</h4>

<p>
If you don't know wheter you are sensitive to carbs, think about whether you experience postprandial sleepiness (fatigue after lunch) after eating pasta and such high carbs food. When i was under the strict keto diet, i rarely if ever experienced that, i could always just resume work just after finishing eating. Indeed, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="eating produces melatonin and serotonin" class="https">eating produces melatonin and serotonin</a>, both having an effect on the circadian clock. Thanks to the PRC, for normal sleepers who eat during the day their meals, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1262766/" title="eating causes slight drowsiness only but does not impact their circadian rhythm because melatonin then gets produced at the &quot;dead zone&quot; of the melatonin PRC" class="https">eating causes slight drowsiness only but does not impact their circadian rhythm because melatonin then gets produced at the "dead zone" of the melatonin PRC</a>, where it has little to no effect, but for non24 and their difficulty in knowing their circadian rhythm, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3860420/" title="a mistimed meal can offset their circadian rhythm one way or the other" class="https">a mistimed meal can offset their circadian rhythm one way or the other</a>, and even just <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/#!po=4.97382" title="the availability of food can shift the circadian rhythm" class="https">the availability of food can shift the circadian rhythm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, a vicious cycle can be created, since <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/sleep-newzzz/201601/unlocking-the-sleep-gut-connection" title="the diet composition and timing affects the gut microbiota, which in turns also affects the body/peripherial circadian clocks" class="https">the diet composition and timing affects the gut microbiota, which in turns also affects the body/peripherial circadian clocks</a>., which may even lead to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="Circadian Syndrome" class="https">Circadian Syndrome</a> (new proposed name for the metabolic syndrome diseases such as diabetes and obesity), with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6694156/" title="a causal relationship having been demonstrated in animals" class="https">a causal relationship having been demonstrated in animals</a>.
</p>

<p>
Hence the necessity of timing meals accordingly to the circadian rhythm and carefully design the composition of one's diet, as it appears food is a "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32363197" title="powerful environmental cue with the potential to destroy or restore the synchrony of circadian rhythms in metabolism" class="https">powerful environmental cue with the potential to destroy or restore the synchrony of circadian rhythms in metabolism</a>".
</p>

Lipids (triglycerides) modulate up to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29264535/" title="30% of the temperature profile's amplitude and stability" class="https">30% of the temperature profile's amplitude and stability</a>, and hence big predictor of circadian rhythm.
</p>

<h4>Chronotherapy</h4>

<p>
The <i>circadian plasticity theory</i>, which is the hypothesis that behavioral interventions can increase or reduce the duration of the circadian period, stems from only a handful of cases of individuals with dspd turning into non24 after a behavioral chronotherapy. These cases may as well have been simple misdiagnoses from the get go, which is certainly not uncommon for circadian rhythm disorders and in particular the rare variants such as sighted non24.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, there is no evidence at all of any individual with non24 getting entrained for a reasonably long period of time with a chronotherapy alone. More anecdotally but still of importance, i think nearly everyone here tried to force themselves to a 24h schedule at some point in their lives, and the fact we are still here looking for a proper treatment only shows these attempts unfortunately failed. Furthermore, the AASM stated in <a href="https://aasm.org/resources/clinicalguidelines/crswd-intrinsic.pdf" title="its guidelines" class="https">its guidelines</a> that only indirect evidence exists, so chronotherapy (or Prescribed Sleep-Wake Scheduling as they call it) is at this point only a "potential therapeutic intervention" with no direct evidence it works, it's only theoretical. This also includes CBT-i (cognitive behavioral intervention for insomnia), which can be seen as a kind of structured chronotherapy or sleep hygiene. Also, it was shown that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25845891" title="night owl chronotypes had less benefits from CBT-i interventions" class="https">night owl chronotypes had less benefits from CBT-i interventions</a>, hence it's arguable whether DSPD and non24 can get any benefit at all.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, i have tried several chronotherapy schemes, including with light therapy. I could never reduce or increase the period, whatever i did. Keep in mind I tried various schemes ranging from the flexible to the extremely rigorous (to give you an idea: I eat everyday the same meal with the same composition and similar quantity everyday and properly timed according to my circadian rhythm since a year now to factor out diet composition and timing as a confounder), so sleep hygiene or rigor was certainly not an issue. There is only one exception being the strict ketogenic diet which multiplied my daily phase delay by 2 (ie, my daily phase delay was 1h instead of 30min), but this is not a chronotherapy and the biological changes induced by this diet are way beyond what a behavioral intervention can achieve.
</p>

<p>
Not only chronotherapy have never shown any effectiveness to treat circadian rhythm disorders, but they are also dangerous because they cause <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="circadian misalignment" class="https">circadian misalignment</a>: forcing someone to be awake and eat at times when their body should naturally be asleep can cause metabolic disorders (themselves potentially causing life-threatening cardiovascular diseases such as strokes over the long-term), partly due to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868293" title="inducing them to eat when endogenous melatonin levels are still elevated" class="https">inducing them to eat when endogenous melatonin levels are still elevated</a>. In fact, the link between metabolic disorders and circadian misalignment is so strong that some researchers suggest to change the name of these diseases to "<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6851668/" title="circadian syndrome" class="https">circadian syndrome</a>".
</p>

<p>
You may still want to try your own chronotherapy, after all you don't risk much in the short term (if not done for longer than 1-2 months) apart from the sleep deprivation you likely already experience as otherwise you wouldn't pursue a way to fix your circadian rhythm. Indeed, either the chronotherapy works and hence even if it goes wrong (ie, increase your phase delay instead of reducing it), you'll know you'll have a leverage to manipulate your circadian rhythm. The idea is that if you can't entrain, you can try to at least find treatments that can modify your phase delay: if you have some treatments that can make it shorter, use it to extend the periods you like, whereas if other treatments make it longer (ie, your daily phase delay is increased, you sleep/wake up later), then use them to skip through the periods you dislike (eg, night walking). Either it doesn't work (as I am unfortunately strongly convinced), and then anyway whatever behavioral intervention you can do won't modify your circadian rhythm a bit, so you'll just have to deal with the temporarily increased sleep deprivation you experienced.
</p>

<p>
If you have a hard time understanding (or making others understand) why the circadian rhythm is unlikely to be manipulable through sheer willpower, you can make an analogy with diabetes: noone wants to be diabetic, and if diabetics could become non-diabetic just by willpower, they certainly all would just do that. Circadian rhythms are the same, they are mostly set in our biological code throughout the body, starting from the DNA and with some potential environmental changes (this is NOT the same as behavioral changes, see epigenetics). This analogy with diabetes may actually be quite accurate seeing how many evidences accumulate linking the two (and other metabolic syndromes, see the Diet subsection in Troubleshooting).

<h4>Ultradian cycles and the "gateways to sleep"</h4>

<p>
According to the famous Borbély's model of sleep, sleep is composed of two processes: process C for the circadian rhythm, and process S for sleep pressure (aka homeostatic sleep). Melatonin is most correlated with the process C, and adenosine with process S. Although these are two different systems, they do <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451994417300068" title="interact with each other" class="https">interact with each other</a> (see also <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30882154" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/E4cKD9iTWHaE7f3AJ/melatonin-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know" title="here" class="https">here</a> and <a href="https://stm.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aba0769" title="here" class="https">here</a>). So using a treatment that affects one will also often affect the other.
</p>

<p>
Ultradian cycles are any cycle smaller than 24h, hence any cycle shorter than circadian. In sleep science, an ultradian cycle refers to the 1h30-2h blocks of vigilance/sleep cycles. This is of importance to fall asleep, because we feel most sleepy (and hence have more ease to fall asleep) between these blocks.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there is a gap of about 20-30 min between each ultradian cycle, which is sometimes called the "gateways to sleep". That's why if you feel sleepy but fight the feeling and stay awake, after 20-30min you will feel more awake again for about 1h30. Hence, ultradian cycles can be a great tool to know when you are going to sleep, as if you feel a bit sleepy but it's too early for you to sleep (or you miss the window opportunity), you can calculate that in about 1h30-2h you will get another opportunity to sleep, and prepare on time to be ready for it. Meanwhile you can do something else, as it is better to get up if you can't sleep than staying in bed.
</p>

<p>
Also, ultradian cycles are like a rebounding ball, with a peak in the middle: there is always one ultradian cycle where the gap will be the peak of tiredness. The other ultradian cycles will be associated with less tiredness, whether before because the process S (sleep pressure) is still building, or after because of dopamine accumulation which counteracts the sleep pressure and creates a "forbidden zone of sleep".
</p>

<p>
This interaction between the processes C, S, dopamine and ultradian cycles explains why if you stay awake past your ideal sleeping time, you will find it more and more difficult to fall asleep, despite the accumulating sleep deprivation and sleep pressure, because of dopamine hiding the feeling of tiredness as more time passes on. That's also why after an all-nighter, you will have a harder time sleeping, despite the obvious sleep deprivation. This dopamine buildup may also be one of the factors causing chaoticity in the sleep patterns after extensive sleep deprivation. Hence why freerunning allows not only to avoid sleep deprivation and be more healthy, but it's also a virtuous cycle where your sleep will stabilize and you'll feel more the natural bedtime tiredness, and hence why it's necessary to freerun before starting any therapy.
</p>

<p>
(TODO: add refs and more infos about forbidden sleep zone, from my post: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/fauke4/forbidden_sleep_zone_dopamine_is_why_the_more/</a>)

<h4>Why do circadian rhythm disorders exist?</h4>

<p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/glz9by/some_of_anthropologys_perspective_on_sleep/" title="Anthropology of sleep" class="https">Anthropology of sleep</a> dates circadian rhythm diversity back to the hunter-gatherers tribes, where it is hypothesized that the various chronotypes allowed to always have someone on guard at any time. This hypothesis seems verified with another study on modern tribes, showing that even nowadays their members have a wide variety of chronotypes, so they have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.0967" title="someone awake at nearly all times to stand guard (only 18 min are left unguarded over 24h)" class="https">someone awake at nearly all times to stand guard (only 18 min are left unguarded over 24h)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Chronotype repartition among the general population is known to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936039/" title="follow a bell shaped curve" class="https">follow a bell shaped curve</a>, in other words a gaussian distribution, which strongly suggests a random and natural variability. In other words, the repartition is normal (in the mathematical sense), no two individuals have the same chronotype/circadian rhythm, and it's ingrained in our biological code (<a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000659" title="~40% of sleep disorders are inherited" class="https">~40% of sleep disorders are inherited</a>).
</p>

<p>
Hence, it's likely that circadian rhythm disorders are just due to natural diversity with the purpose of increasing the survival chances of a community. Unfortunately, with the modern society expectations <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/extreme-night-owls-i-cant-tell-anyone-what-time-i-go-to-bed" title="rooted in agriculture" class="https">rooted in agriculture</a>, chronotypes others than morning larks are at a disadvantage and suffer from <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07420520500545979" title="social jet lag, despite the majority having an intermediate or night owl chronotype" class="https">social jet lag, despite the majority having an intermediate or night owl chronotype</a> (see also <a href="https://carolynschur.com/percentage-of-night-owls-early-birds-and-intermediates-in-the-general-population/" title="here" class="https">here</a>).

</p>

<h4>Sleep hygiene</h4>

<p>
Sleep hygiene is not the solution, it cannot get you entrained. But it can still be helpful.
</p>

<p>
Usual sleep hygiene wisdom can of course help you reduce the negative influence of habits or products: avoid caffeine (coffee, energy drinks, tea) 6h at least before bedtime, make your bedroom comfortable, cosy and with a cool temperature, do not stay in bed if you can't sleep under 30min.
</p>

<p>
Just like food restriction is an unhealthy and ineffective strategy for weight loss, sleep restriction strategies are as bad for sleep and will only worsen circadian rhythm disorders. Several common therapies such as sleep restriction (sleep hygiene only), cognitive therapy or meditation relies on requiring <i>"efforts"</i> from the patient over their sleep, which only lead to further chronic sleep deprivation and dopamine buildup (forbidden sleep zone). Some strategies also require believing, a positive mindset, or other subjective capacity rooted in ableism. The LiDACMel therapy does not require any such "effort" from you, and no therapy should do. The only thing required is your <i>commitment</i> to follow the instructions regularly and at the adequate timing for your circadian rhythm. All steps are done when you are naturally awake, without requiring you to wake up or sleep earlier forcefully. A positive mindset is a plus as it allows to stay motivated and committed, but it's not necessary, and I actually was not believing the therapy would work since I had to iterate several times with variating the parameters until it did eventually, despite me not believing if it was even possible to be entrained at all.
</p>

<p>
If you get entrained, you may feel like your days are shorter. This is because you are used to longer days than 24h. It's important then to remember your commitment to improve your sleep by entrainment, and so to <i>put your sleep first</i>: if you still have work to do but you feel tired, then postpone to tomorrow your work and go to sleep asap.
</p>

<h4>Laziness and willpower</h4>

<p>
People with a circadian rhythm disorder aren't lazy, to the contrary, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/gplcw9/dspds_arent_lazy_heres_the_proof/" title="they put more efforts into waking up than others" class="https">they put more efforts into waking up than others</a>. Indeed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3KQ5p8C8FA" title="laziness has nothing to do with the circadian rhythm" class="https">laziness has nothing to do with the circadian rhythm</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since there is not one circadian clock but lots of them <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677771/" title="throughout the body and down to every cells" class="https">throughout the body and down to every cells</a>, willpower can obviously not change the molecular biology of the circadian processes, just like willpower cannot cure diabetes.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it's highly controversial whether the mind can modify biology. An often cited example is the placebo effect, but according to a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003974.pub3/full" title="Cochrane systematic review, placebo only affects subjective feelings" class="https">Cochrane systematic review, placebo only affects subjective feelings</a>, without modifying any objective measure. In other words, placebos can help see things differently (eg, subjectively feel less pain), but not modify how your body works nor cure a disease. The chronic sleep deprivation induced by circadian rhythm disorders is not a subjective feeling: it is a real and highly dangerous health issue that needs adequate treatments.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, it must be noted that diagnosis criteria are sometimes too broad, so that a study found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28364473" title="half of the individuals diagnosed with DSPD did not have any significant circadian misalignment" class="https">half of the individuals diagnosed with DSPD did not have any significant circadian misalignment</a> (in other words: it was mostly due to bad sleep hygiene and hence easily fixable). This only shows that misdiagnosis is a broad issue for circadian rhythm disorders (and lots of other diseases), without disagreeing with the fact that treating circadian misalignment is currently a very difficult (if not impossible) health issue.
</p>

<h4>Should you use an alarm clock?</h4>

<p>
Alarm clocks are not meant to help with adjusting the circadian rhythm, they only are a way to get up to be on time for appointments. Indeed, they don't prevent your circadian rhythm from freerunning under the hood, as if it was the case, circadian rhythm disorders would not exist since anyone using alarm clocks would be entrained.
</p>

<p>
That's why actually not using an alarm clock is more helpful if you want to get entrained, because then you reduce external factors and also reduce sleep deprivation, which messes up with the circadian rhythm in major ways. But if alarms are necessary because of appointments, then there's nothing to do about it in the short term, and maybe wait for holidays to switch off the alarms and fully dedicate to an entrainment therapy.
</p>

<p>
Also, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27611743" title="wake up time is much more predictive of your circadian rhythm than bedtime" class="https">wake up time is much more predictive of your circadian rhythm than bedtime</a> (see also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15600132" title="here" class="https">here</a>). Hence, with an alarm clock, you are deprived from a very strong indicator to track your sleep and the progress of the entrainment therapy. Indeed, it's possible to wake up at the same time or even earlier regardless of sleep time (whether you slept later or before usual), and in my own experiments, the stability of the wake up time seems to be a strong sign of successful entrainment. 
</p>

<h4>Comorbidities</h4>

<p>
Sleep disorders are associated with lots of other disorders and diseases. It's difficult to know which is causing what, whether it's the sleep disorder that causes the other disease, or if the other disease is worsening the sleep disorder, or if they are both independently caused by another third factor but they interact with each others.
</p>

<p>
Regardless, it's known that sleep disorders can worsen other diseases severity, such as autism, depression and ADHD. But there are also anecdotal reports from some individuals that getting treatment for their other disease (such as ADHD) also helped or sometimes cured their sleep disorder, including non24.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, treating the sleep disorder may help with the other disorders, such as major depression. Indeed, the increased difficulties in social interactions, the lack of routine (and hence increased cognitive load) and the depressed mood are not surprising for someone with non24 or extreme DSPD who is living at night and sleeping during the day. Entrainment, or simply light exposure, can objectively improve the situation, and may reduce the severity of depression along the way. On the other hand, depression can impair the individual's motivation and ability to stay committed to a treatment (therapeutic compliance), so although there is no evidence that treating depression can treat a comorbid circadian rhythm disorder, the mood and motivation improvement can indirectly help by improving compliance.

<h4>Are circadian rhythm disorders real diseases?</h4>

Organic vs non-organic in DSM, recognized and billable in ICD-10

Decreases cognitive performance and alertness (can be dangerous).

<h4>Circadian rhythm disorders: body or brain disorders?</h4>

<p>
Although there is a common misconception that circadian rhythm disorders are either neurological or psychological (as reflected in the DSM and ICD-10 classifications), hence stemming from dysregulations in the brain or thoughts, this can only be qualified as incorrect. First because the circadian rhythm is not solely defined by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the pineal gland, since there are actually molecular clocks in every organs and cells. Secondly because even if the SCN is cyclically secreting melatonin and is hence usually qualified as the "master clock", this is a highly arguable statement since the gastrointestinal tract secretes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2699659/" title="2 orders of magnitude" class="https">2 orders of magnitude</a> (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395907/" title="at least 400x" class="https">at least 400x</a>!) more melatonin in response to food than the SCN. Thirdly, the SCN is unnecessary for circadian shifting, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12395907/" title="as the effect of light, the strongest zeitgeber, on shifting the circadian rhythm is not impacted by the destruction of the SCN" class="https">as the effect of light, the strongest zeitgeber, on shifting the circadian rhythm is not impacted by the destruction of the SCN</a>, which shows that <a href="https://www.theses.fr/2012STRAJ094" title="the non-visual effect of light on the circadian rhythm is independent from the SCN" class="https">the non-visual effect of light on the circadian rhythm is independent from the SCN</a>. As a side-note, the consequences of circadian rhythm disorders, chronic sleep deprivation, also <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.049" title="does not just affect the brain but the whole body via the accumulation of ROS in the guts" class="http">does not just affect the brain but the whole body via the accumulation of ROS in the guts</a>, which <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30555-9.pdf" title="can be rescued using anti-oxydants targeting the guts (through food or gene overexpression), but not when targeting neurons in the brain" class="https">can be rescued using anti-oxydants targeting the guts (through food or gene overexpression), but not when targeting neurons in the brain</a>. It's not for nothing that guts are considered the 2nd brain.
</p>

<p>
Hence, <b>circadian rhythm disorders should more properly be qualified as body disorders</b>, instead of neurological or psychological, as both of the latter conveys a large understatement and misunderstanding of the whole system interactions underlying circadian rhythm disorders, and focusing on brain structures such as the SCN that are in fact unnecessary for circadian rhythm modulation. There is of course a neurological component to these disorders since light is beyond doubt the strongest zeitgeber, but this should not overshadow that this is only a component, not the whole story and maybe not even a core component.

<h4>Similar therapies</h4>

<p>
Anecdotally, there has been multiple reports of success stories using similar therapies:<br>
<ul>
<li>1 year entrainment of a non24 by using light therapy glasses 30min-1h at wake up, dark therapy and melatonin (the poster was previously resistant to melatonin treatment alone - interestingly, he also at some point tried to stop melatonin and use only light therapy, but eventually had to go back to use melatonin for stable entrainment): <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/8bw67q/how_my_non24_treatment_has_allowed_me_to_sleep/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/8bw67q/how_my_non24_treatment_has_allowed_me_to_sleep/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/N24/comments/8bw67q/how_my_non24_treatment_has_allowed_me_to_sleep/</a></li>
<li>3.5 years entrainment at least of a non24, using blue light therapy lamps (lots of them), dark therapy and strict sleep hygiene: <a href="https://non24.blogspot.com/2009/09/synopsis-from-my-teenage-years-until-my.html" title="https://non24.blogspot.com/2009/09/synopsis-from-my-teenage-years-until-my.html" class="https">https://non24.blogspot.com/2009/09/synopsis-from-my-teenage-years-until-my.html</a></li>
<li>10 years+ entrainment of a non24 using a custom bright neon light lamps setup and dark therapy: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cjx2i/iama_non24_i_sleep_every_26_hours_no_matter_what/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cjx2i/iama_non24_i_sleep_every_26_hours_no_matter_what/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cjx2i/iama_non24_i_sleep_every_26_hours_no_matter_what/</a> (the 10+ years of entrainment was confirmed to me in private correspondances)</li>
<li>Eliezer Yudkowsky achieved much better entrainment results for his non24 with properly timed melatonin than with the usually prescribed 1h before bedtime timing, in 2013, combined with light-dark therapy: <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/notes/98/" title="http://www.hpmor.com/notes/98/" class="http">http://www.hpmor.com/notes/98/</a></li>
<li>2+ years of entrainment for a DSPD using light/dark therapy and melatonin: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/h11xok/followup_from_cured_sufferer/" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/h11xok/followup_from_cured_sufferer/" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/comments/h11xok/followup_from_cured_sufferer/</a></li>
<li>Several testimonies for phase advance for individuals with DSPD using the Luminette: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Luminette" title="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Luminette" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=Luminette</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/search?q=Luminette&restrict_sr=1" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/search?q=Luminette&amp;restrict_sr=1" class="https">https://www.reddit.com/r/DSPD/search?q=Luminette&amp;restrict_sr=1</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
And here is the list of previous therapies I have tried myself but which failed to entrain on at least 1 month:<br>
<ol type="1" start="1">
<li>melatonin only, 1h before bedtime or 2-4h before DLMO, this was advised by sleep specialists.</li>
<li>light therapy lamp (medical grade, brand Beurer) + dark therapy (blue light filters, blue blocker glasses) + melatonin 1h before target bedtime, this was advised by sleep specialists.</li>
<li>strict ketogenic diet only (+ dark therapy).</li>
<li>full carbs diet only (+ dark therapy).</li>
<li>intermittent fasting (or even complete fasting for a few days), with and without dark therapy.</li>
<li>time-restricted feeding with big meal timing (with carbs), with and without melatonin 2-4h before DLMO.</li>
<li>serotonin via 5-HTP, either in instant release in the evening to help to sleep, or in long release form in the morning to level up the fluctuation in energy levels.</li>
</ol>
