# VLiDACMel entrainment therapy for the Non-24 Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorder
Work-in-progress draft of a protocol to entrain the Non 24 circadian rhythm disorder (ICD10 code: G47.24). This protocol is (yet) not peer-reviewed.

## VLiDACMel entrainment therapy protocol

The goal is to define a therapy that can reliable entrain the circadian rhythm of (sighted) individuals with non-24 circadian rhythm disorder, using a combination of 2 insights:

1. New therapies based on the careful manipulation and combination of zeitgebers, such as light therapy, melatonin and food timing, can allow for better results. It is hence necessary to determine what is the minimal set of zeitgebers for effective long-term entrainment and what parameters and conditions affect their effeciency on the circadian rhythm.

2. Self-monitoring of the circadian rhythm is necessary to optimally time the therapies on a day-to-day basis and achieve stable therapeutic benefits, as is the case for other chronic diseases such as diabetes where glucose monitoring is necessary. Similarly, circadian rhythm monitoring is a necessity.

The latest working therapy protocol, which worked for 2.5 months and reproduced for 4 months (still ongoing) at the time of this writing, is named **VLiDACMel**, which stands for:

* **V**ery long **Li**ght therapy at wake-up (after minimal core body temperature),
* **D**ark therapy in the evening,
* **A**void **C**arbs and **Mel**atonin mixup,
* and take exogenous instant-release **Mel**atonin timed before DLMO (measured via core body temperature or approximated via 3 days average of wake-up times).

This protocol, along with data of the author's sleep patterns with a > 1y annotated sleep diary, are available in this repository.

I am also open to collaborations (eg, to design a group study on healthy volunteers and/or patients with sighted non-24).

A (messy) side notebook with lots of references along with an older draft protocol (based on chronotherapy and melatonin - which did not work) is available here:

All notebooks were written in [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) and exported with a table of contents using [this template](https://github.com/lrq3000/ZIM-templates). The document may migrate to [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) in the future for publication since the latter supports academic-style bibliography and citations.

## Wearables vitals dataset

In order to both better characterize the non-24 circadian rhythm disorder's phenomenology without intervention, and the effect of the VLiDACMel intervention (and maybe of other interventions) in an objective fashion, the author is developing a set of software tools and self-monitoring wearable devices to monitor the circadian rhythm disorder.

This was split into another project `Wearadian` for better management, see: https://github.com/Circadiaware/wearadian
